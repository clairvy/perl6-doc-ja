<h1 id="Laziness_and_Eagerness">Laziness and Eagerness</h1>
<div id="Laziness_and_Eagerness_CONTENT">
<p>As we all know, one of the primary virtues of the Perl programmer is
laziness.  This is also one of the virtues of Perl itself.  However,
Perl 6 knows better than to succumb to false laziness, and so is eager
sometimes, and lazy others.</p>
<p>One thing that Perl understands is the difference between Laziness and
Eagerness.  When something is Lazy, it says &quot;just give me what you've
got; I'll get the rest later&quot;, whereas when it's eager, it says &quot;More!
More!  Give me everything you can get!&quot;.</p>
<p>Perl 6 defines 4 levels of laziness:</p>
<dl>
	<dt>Strictly Lazy</dt>
	<dd>
		<p>Does not evaluate anything unless explictly required by the user,
including not traversing non-lazy objects.  This behavior is generally
available only by pragma or by explicit programming with non-lazy
primitives.</p>
	</dd>
	<dt>Mostly Lazy</dt>
	<dd>
		<p>Try to obtain available items without causing eager evaluation of
other lazy objects.  However, the implementation is allowed to do batching
for efficiency.</p>
	</dd>
	<dt>Mostly Eager</dt>
	<dd>
		<p>Obtain all items, but does not try to eagerly evaluate when known to
be infinite.</p>
	</dd>
	<dt>Strictly Eager</dt>
	<dd>
		<p>Obtain all items, fail in data structures known to be infinite.
This behavior is generally available only by pragma or by explicit
programming primitives.</p>
	</dd>
</dl>
<p>It's important to realize that the responsibility of determining the
level of laziness/eagerness in each operation is external to each lazy
object, the runtime, depending on which operation is being performed,
is going to assume the level of laziness and perform the needed
operations to apply that level.</p>
</div>
<h2 id="The_laziness_level_of_some_common_op">The laziness level of some common operations</h2>
<div id="The_laziness_level_of_some_common_op-2">
<dl>
	<dt>List Assignment: my @a = @something;</dt>
	<dd>
		<p>In order to provide p5-like behavior in list assignment, this
operation is performed in the Mostly Eager level, meaning that if you do</p>
<pre>  my @a = grep { ... }, @b;
</pre>
		<p>the grep will be evaluated as long as @b is not infinite.</p>
<pre>  my @a = grep { ... }, 1, 2, 3, 4..*
</pre>
		<p>will give grep an infinite list (even if the first elements are
known), therefore it will also be lazy. On the other hand</p>
<pre>  my @a = grep { ... }, 1, 2, 3, 4;
</pre>
		<p>will be eagerly evaluated.</p>
	</dd>
	<dt>Feed operators: my @a &lt;== @something;</dt>
	<dd>
		<p>The feed operator is strictly lazy, meaning that no operation should
be performed before the user requests any element. That's how</p>
<pre>  my @a &lt;== grep { ... } &lt;== map { ... } &lt;== grep { ... } &lt;== 1, 2, 3
</pre>
		<p>is completely lazy, even if 1,2,3 is a fairly small known compact
list.</p>
	</dd>
</dl>
<p>But it's important to notice that eagerness takes precedence over
laziness, meaning that</p>
<pre>  my @a = grep { ... } &lt;== map { ... } &lt;== grep { ... } &lt;== 1, 2, 3
</pre>
<p>Will be eagerly evaluated, but that is still different from</p>
<pre>  my @d = 1,2,3;
  my @c = grep { ... }, @d;
  my @b = map { ... }, @c;
  my @a = grep { ... }, @b;
</pre>
<p>Because in the first, the processing would be made as a flow, avoiding
the creation of the intermediary eager lists that the second example
creates. On the other hand</p>
<pre>  my @d &lt;== 1,2,3;
  my @c &lt;== grep { ... }, @d;
  my @b &lt;== map { ... }, @c;
  my @a = grep { ... }, @b;
</pre>
<p>provides the same laziness level of the first example.</p>
</div>
<h1 id="The_Iterator_Role">The Iterator Role</h1>
<div id="The_Iterator_Role_CONTENT">
<p>The iterator role represents the lazy access to a list, walking through:</p>
<dl>
	<dt>Data structure (list, tree, table, etc)</dt>
	<dt>Feed (map, grep, etc)</dt>
	<dt>Stream (mostly for IO)</dt>
	<dt>In fact, any value that wants to behave like a list</dt>
</dl>
<p>It's important to realize that the iterator of a list can be accessed
by the .Iterator() method (but only the runtime will be calling that
most of the time), and the implementation of each iterator is private
to the list and implementation specific.</p>
<p>This is a minimal API that should allow custom iterator
implementations, but this spec should be expanded in the future to
provide additional API for batch-aware iterators.</p>
<p>The methods in this role are:</p>
</div>
<h2 id="method_get">method get {...}</h2>
<div id="method_get_CONTENT">
<p>Returns the next item for that iteration. The grouping of elements
returned in each iteration is visible if this iterator is being used
to build a slice. While building a List, the items will be flattened.</p>
<p>When it runs out of items, it will return <code>Nil</code>.</p>
</div>
<h1 id="The_Iterator_PushBack_Role">The Iterator::PushBack Role</h1>
<div id="The_Iterator_PushBack_Role_CONTENT">
<p>This role defines an iterator that knows how to receive values back to
be consumed again as if they were never consumed. The iterator is free
to refuse values that were not consumed first and in the correct
order, since this role is not intended to modify the original data,
only to modify the traversal of that data.</p>
</div>
<h2 id="method_pushback_value">method pushback($value) {}</h2>
<div id="method_pushback_value_CONTENT">
<p>This pushes $value back to the array. If this iterator is proxying
immutable data, it is free to refuse a value that is either out of the
original order or if it wasn't consumed. In that case, it should fail
with UnorderedPushBackException or BadPushBackException.</p>
</div>
<h1 id="The_Iterator_Unshift_Role">The Iterator::Unshift Role</h1>
<div id="The_Iterator_Unshift_Role_CONTENT">
<p>This role defines an iterator that can receive new elements in the top
of the stack, it works like pushback, but it should be able to store
objects that are completely new to this stream. Either by being backed
by a mutable list or by providing a local stack. This role implies
Iterator::PushBack, where pushback will be handled by unshift.</p>
<p>The purpose of defining two different Roles is to give the user the
&quot;expect to fail&quot; or &quot;expect to succeed&quot; semantics.</p>
</div>
<h2 id="method_unshift_value">method unshift($value) {}</h2>
<div id="method_unshift_value_CONTENT">
<p>This unshifts $value either to the backed list or to a local stack of
the iterator.</p>
</div>
<h1 id="Auxiliary_Implementations">Auxiliary Implementations</h1>
<div id="Auxiliary_Implementations_CONTENT">
<p>Perl's built-ins require that a number of auxiliary types implement
Iterators.  These are available for general use, and are instantiated
by ending a feed at a scalar, array, or sliced array.</p>
</div>
<h2 id="Generic_Item_Iterator">Generic Item Iterator</h2>
<div id="Generic_Item_Iterator_CONTENT">
<p>To create a generic item iterator, end a feed in a scalar:</p>
<pre>  my $it &lt;== @a;
</pre>
<p>You can later do:</p>
<pre>  my $item = $it.get;
  my @items = @$it;
</pre>
<p>(XXX TODO: effect of type constraints of $it -- maybe to control flattening? )</p>
<p>(XXX TODO:</p>
<pre>   What's this do?

   my $it &lt;== @a; my $it2 &lt;== $it; my $it3 &lt;== $it; get $it2; get $it3;

   ...allow tag team suckling?

   Is it worth the dwim, or do we just forbid it?
</pre>
<p>)</p>
</div>
<h2 id="Generic_Lazy_List">Generic Lazy List</h2>
<div id="Generic_Lazy_List_CONTENT">
<p>To obtain a generic lazy list, end a feed in a <code>Positional</code>.</p>
<pre>my @it &lt;== 1..2000;
</pre>
<p>The generic lazy list consumes the feed on demand.  As the elements of
the list are accessed, values that were in each subsequently returned
<code>Capture</code> are placed at the end of the <code>Positional</code>.  If a <code>Capture</code>
with more than one value is returned, each value is stored at its own
index.  Empty <code>Capture</code>s have no effect, and so the information that
they ever existed at all is lost.</p>
<p>You can later do things like:</p>
<pre>@c = @it[1..5];
$s = @it[4];
</pre>
<p>...and this may run the iterator to find any values which are only
lazily present.  Values which have already been retrieved from the
iterator are kept available unless they are removed, so if you are
working with a large sequence you may want to:</p>
<pre>shift(@it);
</pre>
<p>Reading and writing indices in a generic lazy list iterator will
force consumption and caching of values for all indices up to and
including the accessed one.</p>
<pre>@it[4] = 2;  # @it[0..3] are cached now, @it[4] was consumed/destroyed
</pre>
<p>Adding to the beginning of the list just stores values without
touching the iterators.</p>
<pre>@it.unshift(&lt;a b c&gt;);  # works as expected
</pre>
<p>Trying to find the number of elements in any way may force
eager consumption of the remainder of the values in the iterator,
and trying to access the end of the list certainly will.</p>
<pre>@it.pop; # Eagerness happens.  Maybe bad things, too.
</pre>
<p>...but you had better be very sure that the list is finite.  Attempts to
fiddle with the end of an infinite list may result in the interpreter
raising quite the exception, in the luckiest cases it may just deliver an
<code>Inf</code>, but in some cases you may find yourself spending a very, very
long time doing laps around the yard.  The exact behavior may be
implementation specific.</p>
<p>So don't do that.</p>
<p>If the list is known to be finite, the generic array iterator will
revert to a normal array once the feed is exhausted.  So it is legal
to:</p>
<pre>@it.push; # eagerly exhausts the feed, then turns into to a normal array
</pre>
<p>...with the same caveats about infinity.</p>
<p>(XXX TODO: effect of type constraints/shape of @it? )</p>
<p>(XXX TODO:</p>
<pre>   my @a = (1,2); @a &lt;&lt;== ... promotes an occupied Positional to
   iterator, right? Should probably be explicitly mentioned.
)



</pre>
</div>
<h2 id="Generic_Lazy_Slice">Generic Lazy Slice</h2>
<div id="Generic_Lazy_Slice_CONTENT">
<p>The generic lazy slice consumes the <code>Capture</code>s from an iterator but
stores the results as a bi-dimensional list, where the first dimension
corresponds to an iteration, and the second contains the values in
the <code>Capture</code> returned for that iteration.  Empty <code>Capture</code>s are
stored just like the rest of the iterations.</p>
<p>To obtain a generic lazy slice, end a feed in a sliced <code>Positional</code>.</p>
<pre>my @@it &lt;== map { ... }, 1,2,3;
</pre>
<p>(XXX TODO:</p>
<pre>@@it &lt;== (1,mysub(),2;1,2,3);
@@it[0];
@@it[0;1];

 exactly when does mysub() get called?)



</pre>
</div>
<h1 id="Coroutines">Coroutines</h1>
<div id="Coroutines_CONTENT">
<p>Perl6 does not have a formally defined sub-style coroutine.  Doubtless
there will be external modules to do so in different flavors.  Such a
construct, where many calls made to the name of a sub with different
parameters, expecting to reach the same sub every time, is not really
compatible with multi-method-dispatch.  While it may suit some
programming styles which only use a subset of the Perl6 language, it
cannot be made generally applicable across the Perl6 feature set.</p>
<p>This is not to say you cannot do coroutines in Perl6.  In fact, the
gather/take construct is a simple coroutine.  But if you want to pass
values back and forth Lua-style, you have to use a suplimentary
object:</p>
<pre> sub my_coro (*@slurp) {
    gather do {
        my Int $initval;
        my Str $secondval;
        my Int $thirdval;
        $initval = shift(@slurp);
        $initval++;
        take $initval;
        $secondval = shift(@slurp);
        take &quot;$initval $secondval&quot;;
        $thirdval = shift(@slurp);
        take $thirdval + $initval;
    }
}
my @a = (1);
my $it;
$it &lt;== my_coro() &lt;== while 1 { shift(@a) };
say &quot;First result: &quot; ~ get $it;
@a.push(&quot;Hello World&quot;);
say &quot;Second result: &quot; ~ get $it;
@a.push(500);
say &quot;Third result: &quot; ~ get $it;
</pre>
<p>...if you want to pass multiple parameters on each call, you can
use a slice slurpy instead, to pass a <code>Capture</code>.</p>
<p>The iterator and array can of course be bundled up to give a more
natural feel:</p>
<pre>class my_sub2coro {
    has $!it = Failure;
    has @!data = ();
    has $.coro;
    submethod BUILD {
        $!it &lt;== &amp;($.coro)() &lt;== while 1 { shift(@!data) };
    }
    method corocall($message) {
        @!data.push($message);
        get $!it;
    }
}
my $c = my_sub2coro.new(coro =&gt; &amp;my_coro);
say &quot;First result&quot; ~ $c.corocall(1);
say &quot;Second result&quot; ~ $c.corocall(&quot;Hello World&quot;);
say &quot;Third result&quot; ~ $c.corocall(500);
