<p>This document summarizes Apocalypse 6, which covers subroutines and the
new type system.</p>
</div>
<h1 id="Subroutines_and_other_code_objects">Subroutines and other code objects</h1>
<div id="Subroutines_and_other_code_objects_C">
<p><strong>Subroutines</strong> (keyword: <code>sub</code>) are non-inheritable routines with
parameter lists.</p>
<p><strong>Methods</strong> (keyword: <code>method</code>) are inheritable routines which always
have an associated object (known as their invocant) and belong to a
particular kind or class.</p>
<p><strong>Submethods</strong> (keyword: <code>submethod</code>) are non-inheritable methods, or
subroutines masquerading as methods. They have an invocant and belong to
a particular kind or class.</p>
<p><strong>Regexes</strong> (keyword: <code>regex</code>) are methods (of a grammar) that perform
pattern matching. Their associated block has a special syntax (see
Synopsis 5).  (We also use the term &quot;regex&quot; for anonymous patterns
of the traditional form.)</p>
<p><strong>Tokens</strong> (keyword: <code>token</code>) are regexes that perform low-level
non-backtracking (by default) pattern matching.</p>
<p><strong>Rules</strong> (keyword: <code>rule</code>) are regexes that perform non-backtracking
(by default) pattern matching (and also enable rules to do whitespace
dwimmery).</p>
<p><strong>Macros</strong> (keyword: <code>macro</code>) are routines whose calls execute as soon
as they are parsed (i.e. at compile-time). Macros may return another
source code string or a parse-tree.</p>
</div>
<h1 id="Routine_modifiers">Routine modifiers</h1>
<div id="Routine_modifiers_CONTENT">
<p><strong>Multis</strong> (keyword: <code>multi</code>) are routines that can have multiple
variants that share the same name, selected by arity, types, or some
other constraints.</p>
<p><strong>Prototypes</strong> (keyword: <code>proto</code>) specify the commonalities (such
as parameter names, fixity, and associativity) shared by all multis
of that name in the scope of the <code>proto</code> declaration.  A <code>proto</code>
also adds an implicit <code>multi</code> to all routines of the same short
name within its scope, unless they have an explicit modifier.
(This is particularly useful when adding to rule sets or when attempting
to compose conflicting methods from roles.)</p>
<p><strong>Only</strong> (keyword: <code>only</code>) routines do not share their short names
with other routines.  This is the default modifier for all routines,
unless a <code>proto</code> of the same name was already in scope.</p>
<p>A modifier keyword may occur before the routine keyword in a named routine:</p>
<pre>only sub foo {...}
proto sub foo {...}
multi sub foo {...}

only method bar {...}
proto method bar {...}
multi method bar {...}
</pre>
<p>If the routine keyword is omitted, it defaults to <code>sub</code>.</p>
<p>Modifier keywords cannot apply to anonymous routines.</p>
</div>
<h2 id="Named_subroutines">Named subroutines</h2>
<div id="Named_subroutines_CONTENT">
<p>The general syntax for named subroutines is any of:</p>
<pre> my RETTYPE sub NAME ( PARAMS ) TRAITS {...}    # lexical only
our RETTYPE sub NAME ( PARAMS ) TRAITS {...}    # also package-scoped
            sub NAME ( PARAMS ) TRAITS {...}    # same as &quot;our&quot;
</pre>
<p>The return type may also be put inside the parentheses:</p>
<pre>sub NAME (PARAMS --&gt; RETTYPE) {...}
</pre>
<p>Unlike in Perl 5, named subroutines are considered expressions,
so this is valid Perl 6:</p>
<pre>my @subs = (sub foo { ... }, sub bar { ... });
</pre>
</div>
<h2 id="Anonymous_subroutines">Anonymous subroutines</h2>
<div id="Anonymous_subroutines_CONTENT">
<p>The general syntax for anonymous subroutines is:</p>
<pre>sub ( PARAMS ) TRAITS {...}
</pre>
<p>But one can also use a scope modifier to introduce the return type first:</p>
<pre> my RETTYPE sub ( PARAMS ) TRAITS {...}
our RETTYPE sub ( PARAMS ) TRAITS {...}
</pre>
<p>In this case there is no effective difference, since the distinction between
<code>my</code> and <code>our</code> is only in the handling of the name, and in the case of
an anonymous sub, there's isn't one.</p>
<p><strong>Trait</strong> is the name for a compile-time (<code>is</code>) property.
See <a href="#quot_Properties_and_traits_quot">&quot;Properties and traits&quot;</a>.</p>
</div>
<h2 id="Perl5ish_subroutine_declarations">Perl5ish subroutine declarations</h2>
<div id="Perl5ish_subroutine_declarations_CON">
<p>You can declare a sub without parameter list, as in Perl 5:</p>
<pre>sub foo {...}
</pre>
<p>This is equivalent to</p>
<pre>sub foo (*@_, *%_) {...}
</pre>
<p>Positional arguments implicitly come in via the <code>@_</code> array, but
unlike in Perl 5 they are <code>readonly</code> aliases to actual arguments:</p>
<pre>sub say { print qq{&quot;@_[]&quot;\n}; }   # args appear in @_

sub cap { $_ = uc $_ for @_ }   # Error: elements of @_ are read-only
</pre>
<p>Also unlike in Perl 5, Perl 6 has true named arguments, which come in
via <code>%_</code> instead of <code>@_</code>.  (To construct pseudo-named arguments that
come in via <code>@_</code> as in Perl 5, the p5-to-p6 translator will use the ugly
<code>p5=&gt;</code> operator instead of Perl 6's <code>=&gt;</code> Pair constructor.)</p>
<p>If you need to modify the elements of <code>@_</code> or <code>%_</code>, declare the
array or hash explicitly with the <code>is rw</code> trait:</p>
<pre>sub swap (*@_ is rw, *%_ is rw) { @_[0,1] = @_[1,0]; %_&lt;status&gt; = &quot;Q:S&quot;; }
</pre>
<p>Note: the <code>rw</code> container trait is automatically distributed to the
individual elements by the slurpy star even though there is no
actual array or hash passed in.  More precisely, the slurpy star
means the declared formal parameter is <i>not</i> considered readonly; only
its elements are.  See <a href="#Parameters_and_arguments">Parameters and arguments</a> below.</p>
<p>Note also that if the sub's block contains placeholder variables
(such as <code>$^foo</code> or <code>$:bar</code>), those are considered to be formal
parameters already, so in that case <code>@_</code> or <code>%_</code> fill the role of
sopping up unmatched arguments.  That is, if those containers are
explicitly mentioned within the body, they are added as slurpy
parameters.  This allows you to easily customize your error message
on unrecognized parameters.  If they are not mentioned in the body,
they are not added to the signature, and normal dispatch rules will
simply fail if the signature cannot be bound.</p>
</div>
<h2 id="Blocks">Blocks</h2>
<div id="Blocks_CONTENT">
<p>Raw blocks are also executable code structures in Perl 6.</p>
<p>Every block defines an object of type <code>Block</code> (which <code>does Callable</code>), which may either be
executed immediately or passed on as a <code>Block</code> object.  How a block is
parsed is context dependent.</p>
<p>A bare block where an operator is expected terminates the current
expression and will presumably be parsed as a block by the current
statement-level construct, such as an <code>if</code> or <code>while</code>.  (If no
statement construct is looking for a block there, it's a syntax error.)
This form of bare block requires leading whitespace because a bare
block where a postfix is expected is treated as a hash subscript.</p>




<p>A bare block where a term is expected merely produces a <code>Block</code> object.
If the term bare block occurs in a list, it is considered the final
element of that list unless followed immediately by a comma or colon
(intervening <code>\h*</code> or &quot;unspace&quot; is allowed).</p>
</div>
<h2 id="quot_Pointy_blocks_quot">&quot;Pointy blocks&quot;</h2>
<div id="quot_Pointy_blocks_quot_CONTENT">
<p>Semantically the arrow operator <code>-&gt;</code> is almost a synonym for the
<code>sub</code> keyword as used to declare an anonymous subroutine, insofar as
it allows you to declare a signature for a block of code. However,
the parameter list of a pointy block does not require parentheses,
and a pointy block may not be given traits.  In most respects,
though, a pointy block is treated more like a bare block than like
an official subroutine.  Syntactically, a pointy block may be used
anywhere a bare block could be used:</p>
<pre>my $sq = -&gt; $val { $val**2 };
say $sq(10); # 100

my @list = 1..3;
for @list -&gt; $elem {
    say $elem; # prints &quot;1\n2\n3\n&quot;
}
</pre>
<p>It also behaves like a block with respect to control exceptions.
If you <code>return</code> from within a pointy block, the block is transparent
to the return; it will return from the innermost enclosing <code>sub</code> or
<code>method</code> (et al.), not from the block itself.  It is referenced by <code>&amp;?BLOCK</code>,
not <code>&amp;?ROUTINE</code>.</p>
<p>A normal pointy block's parameters default to <code>readonly</code>, just like
parameters to a normal sub declaration.  However, the double-pointy variant
defaults parameters to <code>rw</code>:</p>
<pre>for @list &lt;-&gt; $elem {
    $elem++;
}
</pre>
<p>This form applies <code>rw</code> to all the arguments:</p>
<pre>for @kv &lt;-&gt; $key, $value {
    $key ~= &quot;.jpg&quot;;
    $value *= 2 if $key ~~ :e;
}
</pre>
</div>
<h2 id="Stub_declarations">Stub declarations</h2>
<div id="Stub_declarations_CONTENT">
<p>To predeclare a subroutine without actually defining it, use a &quot;stub block&quot;:</p>
<pre>sub foo {...}     # Yes, those three dots are part of the actual syntax
</pre>
<p>The old Perl 5 form:</p>
<pre>sub foo;
</pre>
<p>is a compile-time error in Perl 6 (because it would imply that the body of the
subroutine extends from that statement to the end of the file, as <code>class</code> and
<code>module</code> declarations do).  The only allowed use of the semicolon form is to
declare a <code>MAIN</code> sub--see <a href="#Declaring_a_MAIN_subroutine">Declaring a MAIN subroutine</a> below.</p>
<p>Redefining a stub subroutine does not produce an error, but redefining
an already-defined subroutine does. If you wish to redefine a defined sub,
you must explicitly use the &quot;<code>supersede</code>&quot; declarator.  (The compiler may
refuse to do this if it has already committed to the previous definition.)</p>
<p>The <code>...</code> is the &quot;yadayadayada&quot; operator, which is executable but returns
a failure.  You can also use <code>???</code> to produce a warning, or <code>!!!</code> to
always die.  These also officially define stub blocks if used as the
only expression in the block.</p>
<p>It has been argued that <code>...</code> as literal syntax is confusing when
you might also want to use it for metasyntax within a document.
Generally this is not an issue in context; it's never an issue in the
program itself, and the few places where it could be an issue in the
documentation, a comment will serve to clarify the intent, as above.
The rest of the time, it doesn't really matter whether the reader
takes <code>...</code> as literal or not, since the purpose of <code>...</code> is to
indicate that something is missing whichever way you take it.</p>
</div>
<h2 id="Globally_scoped_subroutines">Globally scoped subroutines</h2>
<div id="Globally_scoped_subroutines_CONTENT">
<p>Subroutines and variables can be declared in the global namespace, and are
thereafter visible everywhere in a program via the GLOBAL package.  They
may be made directly visible by importation.</p>
<p>Global subroutines and variables are normally referred to by prefixing
their identifiers with <code>*</code> (short for &quot;<code>GLOBAL::</code>&quot;).</p>
<pre>$*next_id = 0;
sub GLOBAL::saith($text)  { print &quot;Yea verily, $text&quot; }

module A {
    my $next_id = 2;     # hides any global or package $next_id
    &amp;*saith($next_id);   # print the lexical $next_id;
    &amp;*saith($*next_id);  # print the global $next_id;
}

module B {
    use GLOBAL &lt;$next_id&gt;;
    &amp;*saith($next_id);    # Unambiguously the global $next_id
}
</pre>
</div>
<h2 id="Dynamically_scoped_subroutines">Dynamically scoped subroutines</h2>
<div id="Dynamically_scoped_subroutines_CONTE">
<p>Similarly, you may define contextual subroutines:</p>
<pre>my sub myfunc ($x) is context { ... }
</pre>
<p>This may then be invoked via the syntax for contextual variables:</p>
<pre>&amp;*myfunc(42);
</pre>
</div>
<h2 id="Lvalue_subroutines">Lvalue subroutines</h2>
<div id="Lvalue_subroutines_CONTENT">
<p>Lvalue subroutines return a &quot;proxy&quot; object that can be assigned to.
It's known as a proxy because the object usually represents the
purpose or outcome of the subroutine call.</p>
<p>Subroutines are specified as being lvalue using the <code>is rw</code> trait.</p>
<p>An lvalue subroutine may return a variable:</p>
<pre>my $lastval;
sub lastval () is rw { return $lastval }
</pre>
<p>or the result of some nested call to an lvalue subroutine:</p>
<pre>sub prevval () is rw { return lastval() }
</pre>
<p>or a specially tied proxy object, with suitably programmed
<code>FETCH</code> and <code>STORE</code> methods:</p>
<pre>sub checklastval ($passwd) is rw {
    return new Proxy:
            FETCH =&gt; method {
                        return lastval();
                     },
            STORE =&gt; method ($val) {
                        die unless check($passwd);
                        lastval() = $val;
                     };
}
</pre>
<p>Other methods may be defined for specialized purposes such as temporizing
the value of the proxy.</p>
</div>
<h2 id="Operator_overloading">Operator overloading</h2>
<div id="Operator_overloading_CONTENT">
<p>Operators are just subroutines with special names and scoping.
An operator name consists of a grammatical category name followed by
a single colon followed by an operator name specified as if it were
a hash subscript (but evaluated at compile time).  So any of these
indicates the same binary addition operator:</p>
<pre>infix:&lt;+&gt;
infix:«+»
infix:&lt;&lt;+&gt;&gt;
infix:{'+'}
infix:{&quot;+&quot;}
</pre>
<p>Use the <code>&amp;</code> sigil just as you would on ordinary subs.</p>
<p>Unary operators are defined as <code>prefix</code> or <code>postfix</code>:</p>
<pre>sub prefix:&lt;OPNAME&gt;  ($operand) {...}
sub postfix:&lt;OPNAME&gt; ($operand) {...}
</pre>
<p>Binary operators are defined as <code>infix</code>:</p>
<pre>sub infix:&lt;OPNAME&gt; ($leftop, $rightop) {...}
</pre>
<p>Bracketing operators are defined as <code>circumfix</code> where a term is expected
or <code>postcircumfix</code> where a postfix is expected.  A two-element slice
containing the leading and trailing delimiters is the name of the
operator.</p>
<pre>sub circumfix:&lt;LEFTDELIM RIGHTDELIM&gt; ($contents) {...}
sub circumfix:{'LEFTDELIM','RIGHTDELIM'} ($contents) {...}
</pre>
<p>Contrary to Apocalypse 6, there is no longer any rule about splitting an even
number of characters.  You must use a two-element slice.  Such names
are canonicalized to a single form within the symbol table, so you
must use the canonical name if you wish to subscript the symbol table
directly (as in <code>PKG::{'infix:&lt;+&gt;'}</code>).  Otherwise any form will
do.  (Symbolic references do not count as direct subscripts since they
go through a parsing process.)  The canonical form always uses angle
brackets and a single space between slice elements.  The elements
are not escaped, so <code>PKG::circumfix:{'&lt;','&gt;'}</code> is canonicalized
to <code>PKG::{'circumfix:&lt;&lt; &gt;&gt;'}</code>, and decanonicalizing always
involves stripping the outer angles and splitting on space, if any.
This works because a hash key knows how long it is, so there's no
ambiguity about where the final angle is.  And space works because
operators are not allowed to contain spaces.</p>
<p>Operator names can be any sequence of non-whitespace characters
including Unicode characters. For example:</p>
<pre>sub infix:&lt;(c)&gt; ($text, $owner) { return $text but Copyright($owner) }
method prefix:&lt;±&gt; (Num $x --&gt; Num) { return +$x | -$x }
multi sub postfix:&lt;!&gt; (Int $n) { $n &lt; 2 ?? 1 !! $n*($n-1)! }
macro circumfix:«&lt;!-- --&gt;» ($text) is parsed / .*? / { &quot;&quot; }

my $document = $text (c) $me;

my $tolerance = ±7!;

&lt;!-- This is now a comment --&gt;
</pre>
<p>Whitespace may never be part of the name (except as separator
within a <code>&lt;...&gt;</code> or <code>«...»</code> slice subscript, as in the example above).</p>
<p>A null operator name does not define a null or whitespace operator, but
a default matching subrule for that syntactic category, which is useful when
there is no fixed string that can be recognized, such as tokens beginning
with digits.  Such an operator <i>must</i> supply an <code>is parsed</code> trait.
The Perl grammar uses a default subrule for the <code>:1st</code>, <code>:2nd</code>, <code>:3rd</code>,
etc. regex modifiers, something like this:</p>
<pre>sub regex_mod_external:&lt;&gt; ($x) is parsed(token { \d+[st|nd|rd|th] }) {...}
</pre>
<p>Such default rules are attempted in the order declared.  (They always follow
any rules with a known prefix, by the longest-token-first rule.)</p>
<p>Although the name of an operator can be installed into any package or
lexical namespace, the syntactic effects of an operator declaration are
always lexically scoped.  Operators other than the standard ones should
not be installed into the <code>*</code> namespace.  Always use exportation to make
non-standard syntax available to other scopes.</p>
</div>
<h1 id="Parameters_and_arguments">Parameters and arguments</h1>
<div id="Parameters_and_arguments_CONTENT">
<p>Perl 6 subroutines may be declared with parameter lists.</p>
<p>By default, all parameters are readonly aliases to their corresponding
arguments--the parameter is just another name for the original
argument, but the argument can't be modified through it.  This is
vacuously true for value arguments, since they may not be modified in
any case.  However, the default forces any container argument to also
be treated as an immutable value.  This extends down only one level;
an immutable container may always return an element that is mutable if
it so chooses.  (For this purpose a scalar variable is not considered
a container of its singular object, though, so the top-level object
within a scalar variable is considered immutable by default.  Perl 6
does not have references in the same sense that Perl 5 does.)</p>
<p>To allow modification, use the <code>is rw</code> trait.  This requires a mutable
object or container as an argument (or some kind of type object that
can be converted to a mutable object, such as might be returned
by an array or hash that knows how to autovivify new elements).
Otherwise the signature fails to bind, and this candidate routine
cannot be considered for servicing this particular call.  (Other multi
candidates, if any, may succeed if they don't require <code>rw</code> for this
parameter.)  In any case, failure to bind does not by itself cause
an exception to be thrown; that is completely up to the dispatcher.</p>
<p>To pass-by-copy, use the <code>is copy</code> trait.  An object container will
be cloned whether or not the original is mutable, while an (immutable)
value will be copied into a suitably mutable container.  The parameter
may bind to any argument that meets the other typological constraints
of the parameter.</p>
<p>If you have a readonly parameter <code>$ro</code>, it may never be passed on to
a <code>rw</code> parameter of a subcall, whether or not <code>$ro</code> is currently
bound to a mutable object.  It may only be rebound to readonly or
copy parameters.  It may also be rebound to a <code>ref</code> parameter (see
&quot;<code>is ref</code>&quot; below), but modification will fail as in the case where
an immutable value is bound to a <code>ref</code> parameter.</p>
<p>Aliases of <code>$ro</code> are also readonly, whether generated explicitly with <code>:=</code>
or implicitly within a <code>Capture</code> object (which are themselves immutable).</p>
<p>Also, <code>$ro</code> may not be returned from an lvalue subroutine or method.</p>
<p>Parameters may be required or optional. They may be passed by position,
or by name. Individual parameters may confer an item or list context
on their corresponding arguments, but unlike in Perl 5, this is decided
lazily at parameter binding time.</p>
<p>Arguments destined for required positional parameters must come before
those bound to optional positional parameters. Arguments destined
for named parameters may come before and/or after the positional
parameters.  (To avoid confusion it is highly recommended that all
positional parameters be kept contiguous in the call syntax, but
this is not enforced, and custom arg list processors are certainly
possible on those arguments that are bound to a final slurpy or
arglist variable.)</p>
</div>
<h2 id="Named_arguments">Named arguments</h2>
<div id="Named_arguments_CONTENT">
<p>Named arguments are recognized syntactically at the &quot;comma&quot; level.
Since parameters are identified using identifiers, the recognized
syntaxes are those where the identifier in question is obvious.
You may use either the adverbial form, <code>:name($value)</code>, or the
autoquoted arrow form, <code>name =&gt; $value</code>.  These must occur at
the top &quot;comma&quot; level, and no other forms are taken as named pairs
by default.  Pairs intended as positional arguments rather than named
arguments may be indicated by extra parens or by explicitly quoting
the key to suppress autoquoting:</p>
<pre>doit :when&lt;now&gt;,1,2,3;      # always a named arg
doit (:when&lt;now&gt;),1,2,3;    # always a positional arg

doit when =&gt; 'now',1,2,3;   # always a named arg
doit (when =&gt; 'now'),1,2,3; # always a positional arg
doit 'when' =&gt; 'now',1,2,3; # always a positional arg
</pre>
<p>Only bare keys with valid identifier names are recognized as named arguments:</p>
<pre>doit when =&gt; 'now';         # always a named arg
doit 'when' =&gt; 'now';       # always a positional arg
doit 123  =&gt; 'now';         # always a positional arg
doit :123&lt;now&gt;;             # always a positional arg
</pre>
<p>Going the other way, pairs intended as named arguments that don't look
like pairs must be introduced with the <code>|</code> prefix operator:</p>
<pre>$pair = :when&lt;now&gt;;
doit $pair,1,2,3;                # always a positional arg
doit |$pair,1,2,3;               # always a named arg
doit |get_pair(),1,2,3;          # always a named arg
doit |('when' =&gt; 'now'),1,2,3;   # always a named arg
</pre>
<p>Note the parens are necessary on the last one due to precedence.</p>
<p>Likewise, if you wish to pass a hash and have its entries treated as
named arguments, you must dereference it with a <code>|</code>:</p>
<pre>%pairs = (:when&lt;now&gt;, :what&lt;any&gt;);
doit %pairs,1,2,3;               # always a positional arg
doit |%pairs,1,2,3;              # always named args
doit |%(get_pair()),1,2,3;       # always a named arg
doit |%('when' =&gt; 'now'),1,2,3;  # always a named arg
</pre>
<p>Variables with a <code>:</code> prefix in rvalue context autogenerate pairs, so you
can also say this:</p>
<pre>$when = 'now';
doit $when,1,2,3;   # always a positional arg of 'now'
doit :$when,1,2,3;  # always a named arg of :when&lt;now&gt;
</pre>
<p>In other words <code>:$when</code> is shorthand for <code>:when($when)</code>.  This works
for any sigil:</p>
<pre>:$what      :what($what)
:@what      :what(@what)
:%what      :what(%what)
:&amp;what      :what(&amp;what)
</pre>
<p>Ordinary hash notation will just pass the value of the hash entry as a
positional argument regardless of whether it is a pair or not.
To pass both key and value out of hash as a positional pair, use <code>:p</code>
instead:</p>
<pre>doit %hash&lt;a&gt;:p,1,2,3;
doit %hash{'b'}:p,1,2,3;
</pre>
<p>The <code>:p</code> stands for &quot;pairs&quot;, not &quot;positional&quot;--the <code>:p</code> adverb may be
placed on any <code>Associative</code> access subscript to make it mean &quot;pairs&quot; instead of &quot;values&quot;.
If you want the pair (or pairs) to be interpreted a named argument,
you may do so by prefixing with the <code>prefix:&lt;|&gt;</code> operator:</p>
<pre>doit |%hash&lt;a&gt;:p,1,2,3;
doit |%hash{'b'}:p,1,2,3;
</pre>
<p><code>Pair</code> constructors are recognized syntactically at the call level and
put into the named slot of the <code>Capture</code> structure.  Hence they may be
bound to positionals only by name, not as ordinary positional <code>Pair</code>
objects.  Leftover named arguments can be slurped into a slurpy hash.</p>
<p>Because named and positional arguments can be freely mixed, the
programmer always needs to disambiguate pairs literals from named
arguments with parentheses or quotes:</p>
<pre># Named argument &quot;a&quot;
push @array, 1, 2, :a&lt;b&gt;;

# Pair object (a=&gt;'b')
push @array, 1, 2, (:a&lt;b&gt;);
push @array, 1, 2, 'a' =&gt; 'b';
</pre>
<p>Perl 6 allows multiple same-named arguments, and records the relative
order of arguments with the same name.  When there are more than one
argument, the <code>@</code> sigil in the parameter list causes the arguments
to be concatenated:</p>
<pre>sub fun (Int @x) { ... }
fun( x =&gt; 1, x =&gt; 2 );              # @x := (1, 2)

<p>The invocant is actually stored as the first positional argument of a <code>Capture</code>
object.  It is special only to the dispatcher, otherwise it's just a normal
positional argument.</p>
<p>Single-dispatch semantics may also be requested by using the indirect object syntax, with a colon
after the invocant argument. The colon is just a special form of the comma, and has the
same precedence:</p>
<pre>set_name $obj: &quot;Sam&quot;;   # try $obj.set_name(&quot;Sam&quot;) first, then

<p>If you have call of the form:</p>

<p>the compiler must defer the decision on whether to treat it as a single

<p>A routine marked with <code>multi</code> can mark part of its parameters to

see S12 for more about the semantics of multiple dispatch.</p>
<p>You can choose part of a <code>multi</code>'s parameters to be its longname,

long names, delimited by single semicolons.  See S12 for details.]</p>
<p>If the parameter list for a <code>multi</code> contains no semicolons to delimit
the list of important parameters, then all positional parameters are

The <code>=</code> sign introduces a default value:</p>

<p>If the longhand form is used, the label name and variable name can be
different:</p>

<p>Or equivalently:</p>
<pre>sub globalize (:g(:$global)) {...}

$formal = formalize($title, justify=&gt;'left');
$formal = formalize($title, :justify&lt;right&gt;, :case&lt;title&gt;);

<p>See S02 for the correspondence between adverbial form and arrow notation.</p>
<p>While named and position arguments may be intermixed, it is suggested
that you keep all the positionals in one place for clarity unless you
have a good reason not to.  This is likely bad style:</p>
<pre>$formal = formalize(:justify&lt;right&gt;, $title, :case&lt;title&gt;, $date);
</pre>
<p>Named parameters are optional unless marked with a following <code>!</code>.
Default values for optional named parameters are defined in the same
way as for positional parameters, but may depend only on existing
values, including the values of parameters that have already been
bound.  Named optional parameters default to <code>undef</code> if they have
no default.  Named required parameters fail unless an argument pair
of that name is supplied.</p>
<p>Bindings happen in declaration order, not call order, so any default
may reliably depend on formal parameters to its left in the signature.
In other words, if the first parameter is <code>$a</code>, it will bind to
a <code>:a()</code> argument in preference to the first positional argument.
It might seem that performance of binding would suffer by requiring
a named lookup before a positional lookup, but the compiler is able
to guarantee that subs with known fixed signatures (both <code>only</code>s and
<code>multi</code>s with <code>proto</code>s) translate named arguments to positional in the
first N positions.  Also, purely positional calls may obviously omit any
named lookups, as may bindings that have already used up all the named
arguments.  The compiler is also free to intuit proto signatures for
a given sub or method name as long as the candidate list is stable..</p>

<h2 id="List_parameters">List parameters</h2>
<div id="List_parameters_CONTENT">
<p>List parameters capture a variable length list of data. They're used
in subroutines like <code>print</code>, where the number of arguments needs to be
flexible. They're also called &quot;variadic parameters&quot;, because they take a
<i>variable</i> number of arguments.  But generally we call them &quot;slurpy&quot;
parameters because they slurp up arguments.</p>
<p>Slurpy parameters follow any required or optional parameters. They are
marked by a <code>*</code> before the parameter:</p>
<pre>sub duplicate($n, *%flag, *@data) {...}
</pre>
<p>Named arguments are bound to the slurpy hash (<code>*%flag</code>
in the above example). Such arguments are evaluated in item context.
Any remaining variadic arguments at the end of the argument list
are bound to the slurpy array (<code>*@data</code> above) and are evaluated
in list context.</p>
<p>For example:</p>
<pre>duplicate(3, reverse =&gt; 1, collate =&gt; 0, 2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 14);
duplicate(3, :reverse, :!collate, 2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 14);  # same

# The @data parameter receives [2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 14]
# The %flag parameter receives { reverse =&gt; 1, collate =&gt; 0 }
</pre>
<p>Slurpy scalar parameters capture what would otherwise be the first
elements of the variadic array:</p>
<pre>sub head(*$head, *@tail)         { return $head }
sub neck(*$head, *$neck, *@tail) { return $neck }
sub tail(*$head, *@tail)         { return @tail }

head(1, 2, 3, 4, 5);        # $head parameter receives 1
                            # @tail parameter receives [2, 3, 4, 5]

neck(1, 2, 3, 4, 5);        # $head parameter receives 1
                            # $neck parameter receives 2
                            # @tail parameter receives [3, 4, 5]
</pre>
<p>Slurpy scalars still impose list context on their arguments.</p>
<p>Slurpy parameters are treated lazily -- the list is only flattened
into an array when individual elements are actually accessed:</p>
<pre>@fromtwo = tail(1..Inf);        # @fromtwo contains a lazy [2..Inf]
</pre>
<p>You can't bind to the name of a slurpy parameter: the name is just there
so you can refer to it within the body.</p>
<pre>sub foo(*%flag, *@data) {...}

foo(:flag{ a =&gt; 1 }, :data[ 1, 2, 3 ]);

<p>Some functions take more than one list of positional and/or named arguments,
that they wish not to be flattened into one list.  For instance, <code>zip()</code> wants
to iterate several lists in parallel, while array and hash subscripts want to

bound to a single array parameter declared with a double <code>@@</code> sigil:</p>

<p>insofar as <code>|$slice</code> is bound to a single argument-list object that
makes no commitment to processing its structure (and maybe doesn't
even know its own structure yet), while <code>*@@slice</code> has to create
an array that binds the incoming dimensional lists to the array's
dimensions, and make that commitment visible to the rest of the scope

<h2 id="Feed_operators">Feed operators</h2>
<div id="Feed_operators_CONTENT">
<p>The variadic list of a subroutine call can be passed in separately from
the normal argument list, by using either of the <i>feed</i> operators:
<code>&lt;==</code> or <code>==&gt;</code>.  Syntactically, feed operators expect to find a
statement on either end.  Any statement can occur on the source end;
however not all statements are suitable for use on the sink end of a feed.</p>
<p>Each operator expects to find a call to a variadic receiver on its
&quot;sharp&quot; end, and a list of values on its &quot;blunt&quot; end:</p>
<pre>grep { $_ % 2 } &lt;== @data;

@data ==&gt; grep { $_ % 2 };
</pre>
<p>It binds the (potentially lazy) list from the blunt end to the slurpy
parameter(s) of the receiver on the sharp end.  In the case of a receiver
that is a variadic function, the feed is received as part of its slurpy list.
So both of the calls above are equivalent to:</p>
<pre>grep { $_ % 2 }, @data;
</pre>
<p>Note that all such feeds (and indeed all lazy argument lists) supply
an implicit promise that the code producing the lists may execute
in parallel with the code receiving the lists.  (Feeds, hyperops,
and junctions all have this promise of parallelizability in common,
but differ in interface.  Code which violates these promises is
erroneous, and will produce undefined results when parallelized.)</p>
<p>However, feeds go a bit further than ordinary lazy lists in enforcing
the parallel discipline: they explicitly treat the blunt end as a
cloned closure that starts a subthread (presumably cooperative).  The only variables shared
by the inner scope with the outer scope are those lexical variables
declared in the outer scope that are visible at the time the closure is
cloned and the subthread spawned.  Use of such shared variables will
automatically be subject to transactional protection (and associated
overhead).  Package variables are not cloned unless predeclared
as lexical names with <code>our</code>.  Variables declared within the blunt
end are not visible outside, and in fact it is illegal to declare a
lexical on the blunt end that is not enclosed in curlies somehow.</p>
<p>Because feeds are defined as lazy pipes, a chain of feeds may not begin
and end with the same array without some kind of eager sequence point.
That is, this isn't guaranteed to work:</p>
<pre>@data &lt;== grep { $_ % 2 } &lt;== @data;
</pre>
<p>either of these do:</p>
<pre>@data &lt;== grep { $_ % 2 } &lt;== eager @data;
@data &lt;== eager grep { $_ % 2 } &lt;== @data;
</pre>
<p>Conjecture: if the cloning process eagerly duplicates <code>@data</code>, it could
be forced to work.  Not clear if this is desirable, since ordinary clones
just clone the container, not the value.</p>
<p>Leftward feeds are a convenient way of explicitly indicating the typical
right-to-left flow of data through a chain of operations:</p>
<pre>@oddsquares = map { $_**2 }, sort grep { $_ % 2 }, @nums;

# perhaps more clearly written as...

@oddsquares = do {
    map { $_**2 } &lt;== sort &lt;== grep { $_ % 2 } &lt;== @nums;
}
</pre>
<p>Rightward feeds are a convenient way of reversing the normal data flow in a
chain of operations, to make it read left-to-right:</p>
<pre>@oddsquares = do {
    @nums ==&gt; grep { $_ % 2 } ==&gt; sort ==&gt; map { $_**2 };
}
</pre>
<p>Note that something like the <code>do</code> is necessary because feeds operate
at the statement level.  Parens would also work, since a statement is
expected inside:</p>
<pre>@oddsquares = (
    @nums ==&gt; grep { $_ % 2 } ==&gt; sort ==&gt; map { $_**2 };
);
</pre>
<p>But as described below, you can also just write:</p>
<pre>@nums ==&gt; grep { $_ % 2 } ==&gt; sort ==&gt; map { $_**2 } ==&gt; @oddsquares;
</pre>
<p>If the operand on the sharp end of a feed is not a call to a variadic
operation, it must be something else that can be interpreted as a list
receiver, or a scalar expression that can be evaluated to produce an
object that does the <code>KitchenSink</code> role, such as an <code>IO</code> object.
Such an object provides <code>.clear</code> and <code>.push</code> methods that will
be called as appropriate to send data.  (Note that an <code>IO</code> object
used as a sink will force eager evaluation on its pipeline, so the
next statement is guaranteed not to run till the file is closed.
In contrast, an <code>Array</code> object used as a sink turns into a lazy
array.)</p>
<p>Any non-variadic object (such as an <code>Array</code> or <code>IO</code> object) used as a filter
between two feeds is treated specially as a <i>tap</i> that merely captures
data <i>en passant</i>.  You can safely install such a tap in an extended pipeline
without changing the semantics.  An <code>IO</code> object used as a tap does not
force eager evaluation since the eagerness is controlled instead by the
downstream feed.</p>
<p>Any prefix list operator is considered a variadic operation, so ordinarily
a list operator adds any feed input to the end of its list.
But sometimes you want to interpolate elsewhere, so any contextualizer
with <code>*</code> as an argument may be used to indicate the target of a
feed without the use of a temporary array:</p>
<pre>foo() ==&gt; say @(*), &quot; is what I meant&quot;;
bar() ==&gt; @@(*).baz();
</pre>
<p>Likewise, an <code>Array</code> used as a tap may be distinguished from an <code>Array</code> used
as a translation function:</p>
<pre>numbers() ==&gt; @array ==&gt; bar()          # tap
numbers() ==&gt; @array[@(*)] ==&gt; bar()    # translation
</pre>
<p>Feeding into the <code>*</code> &quot;whatever&quot; term sets the source for the next sink.
To append multiple sources to the next sink, double the angle:</p>
<pre>0..*       ==&gt;  *;
'a'..*     ==&gt;&gt; *;
pidigits() ==&gt;&gt; *;

# outputs &quot;(0, 'a', 3)\n&quot;...
for zip(@@(*)) { .perl.say }
</pre>
<p>You may use a variable (or variable declaration) as a receiver, in
which case the list value is bound as the &quot;todo&quot; of the variable.
(The append form binds addition todos to the receiver's todo list.)
Do not think of it as an assignment, nor as an ordinary binding.
Think of it as iterator creation.  In the case of a scalar variable,
that variable contains the newly created iterator itself.  In the case
of an array, the new iterator is installed as the method for extending
the array.  As with assignment, the old todo list is clobbered; use the
append form to avoid that and get push semantics.</p>
<p>In general you can simply think of a receiver array as representing
the results of the chain, so you can equivalently write any of:</p>
<pre>my @oddsquares &lt;== map { $_**2 } &lt;== sort &lt;== grep { $_ % 2 } &lt;== @nums;

my @oddsquares
    &lt;== map { $_**2 }
    &lt;== sort
    &lt;== grep { $_ % 2 }
    &lt;== @nums;

@nums ==&gt; grep { $_ % 2 } ==&gt; sort ==&gt; map { $_**2 } ==&gt; my @oddsquares;

@nums
==&gt; grep { $_ % 2 }
==&gt; sort
==&gt; map { $_**2 }
==&gt; my @oddsquares;
</pre>
<p>Since the feed iterator is bound into the final variable, the variable
can be just as lazy as the feed that is producing the values.</p>
<p>When feeds are bound to arrays with &quot;push&quot; semantics, you can have
a receiver for multiple feeds:</p>
<pre>my @foo;
0..2       ==&gt;  @foo;
'a'..'c'   ==&gt;&gt; @foo;
say @foo;   # 0,1,2,'a','b','c'
</pre>
<p>Note how the feeds are concatenated in <code>@foo</code> so that <code>@foo</code>
is a list of 6 elements.  This is the default behavior.  However,
sometimes you want to capture the outputs as a list of two iterators,
namely the two iterators that represent the two input feeds.  You can
get at those two iterators by using the name <code>@@foo</code> instead, where
the &quot;slice&quot; sigil marks a multidimensional array, that is, an
array of lists, each of which may be treated independently.</p>
<pre>0..*       ==&gt;  @@foo;
'a'..*     ==&gt;&gt; @@foo;
pidigits() ==&gt;&gt; @@foo;

for zip(@@foo) { .say }

    [0,'a',3]
    [1,'b',1]
    [2,'c',4]
    [3,'d',1]
    [4,'e',5]
    [5,'f',9]
    ...
</pre>
<p>Here <code>@@foo</code> is an array of three iterators, so</p>
<pre>zip(@@foo)
</pre>
<p>is equivalent to</p>
<pre>zip(@@foo[0]; @@foo[1]; @@foo[2])
</pre>
<p>A semicolon inside brackets is equivalent to stacked feeds.  The code above
could be rewritten as:</p>
<pre>(0..*; 'a'..*; pidigits()) ==&gt; my @@foo;
for @@foo.zip { .say }
</pre>
<p>which is in turn equivalent to</p>
<pre>for zip(0..*; 'a'..*; pidigits()) { .say }
</pre>
<p>A named receiver array is useful when you wish to feed into an
expression that is not an ordinary list operator, and you wish to be
clear where the feed's destination is supposed to be:</p>
<pre>picklist() ==&gt; my @baz;
my @foo = @bar[@baz];
</pre>
<p>Various contexts may or may not be expecting multi-dimensional slices
or feeds.  By default, ordinary arrays are flattened, that is, they
have &quot;list&quot; semantics.  If you say</p>
<pre>(0..2; 'a'..'c') ==&gt; my @tmp;
for @tmp { .say }
</pre>
<p>then you get 0,1,2,'a','b','c'.  If you have a multidim array, you
can ask for list semantics explicitly with list():</p>
<pre>(0..2; 'a'..'c') ==&gt; my @@tmp;
for @@tmp.list { .say }
</pre>
<p>As we saw earlier, &quot;zip&quot; produces an interleaved result by taking one element
from each list in turn, so</p>
<pre>(0..2; 'a'..'c') ==&gt; my @@tmp;
for @@tmp.zip { .say }
</pre>
<p>produces 0,'a',1,'b',2,'c'.</p>
<p>If you want the result as a list of subarrays, then you need to put
the zip into a &quot;chunky&quot; context instead:</p>
<pre>(0..2; 'a'..'c') ==&gt; my @@tmp;
for @@tmp.zip.@@() { .say }
</pre>
<p>This produces [0,'a'],[1,'b'],[2,'c'].  But usually you want the flat
form so you can just bind it directly to a signature:</p>
<pre>for @@tmp.zip -&gt; $i, $a { say &quot;$i: $a&quot; }
</pre>
<p>Otherwise you'd have to say this:</p>
<pre>for @@tmp.zip.slice -&gt; [$i, $a] { say &quot;$i: $a&quot; }
</pre>
<p>In list context the <code>@@foo</code> notation is really a shorthand for <code>[;](@@foo)</code>.
In particular, you can use <code>@@foo</code> to interpolate a multidimensional slice
in an array or hash subscript.</p>
<p>If <code>@@foo</code> is currently empty, then <code>for zip(@@foo) {...}</code> acts on a
zero-dimensional slice (i.e. <code>for (zip) {...}</code>), and outputs nothing
at all.</p>
<p>Note that with the current definition, the order of feeds is preserved
left to right in general regardless of the position of the receiver.</p>
<p>So</p>
<pre>('a'..*; 0..*) ==&gt; *;
 for zip(@@(*) &lt;== @foo) -&gt; $a, $i, $x { ... }
</pre>
<p>is the same as</p>
<pre>'a'..* ==&gt; *;
 0..*  ==&gt; *;
 for zip(@@(*) &lt;== @foo) -&gt; $a, $i, $x { ... }
</pre>
<p>which is the same as</p>
<pre>for zip('a'..*; 0..*; @foo) -&gt; $a, $i, $x { ... }
</pre>
<p>Also note that these come out to be identical for ordinary arrays:</p>
<pre>@foo.zip
@foo.cat
</pre>
<p>The <code>@@($foo)</code> coercer can be used to pull a multidim out of some
object that contains one, such as a <code>Capture</code> or <code>Match</code> object.  Like
<code>@()</code>, <code>@@()</code> defaults to <code>@@($/)</code>, and returns a multidimensional
view of any match that repeatedly applies itself with <code>:g</code> and
the like.  In contrast, <code>@()</code> would flatten those into one list.
It is an error to use <code>@(*)</code> or <code>@@(*)</code> in a context that doesn't
supply a feed somehow.</p>

<h2 id="Closure_parameters">Closure parameters</h2>
<div id="Closure_parameters_CONTENT">
<p>Parameters declared with the <code>&amp;</code> sigil take blocks, closures, or

optional, named, or slurpy.</p>
<pre>sub limited_grep (Int $count, &amp;block, *@list) {...}

# and later...

@first_three = limited_grep 3, {$_&lt;10}, @data;
</pre>
<p>(The comma is required after the closure.)</p>
<p>Within the subroutine, the closure parameter can be used like any other
lexically scoped subroutine:</p>
<pre>sub limited_grep (Int $count, &amp;block, *@list) {
    ...
    if block($nextelem) {...}
    ...
}
</pre>
<p>The closure parameter can have its own signature in a type specification written
with <code>:(...)</code>:</p>
<pre>sub limited_Dog_grep ($count, &amp;block:(Dog), Dog *@list) {...}
</pre>
<p>and even a return type:</p>
<pre>sub limited_Dog_grep ($count, &amp;block:(Dog --&gt; Bool), Dog *@list) {...}
</pre>
<p>When an argument is passed to a closure parameter that has this kind of
signature, the argument must be a <code>Code</code> object with a compatible
parameter list and return type.</p>
</div>
<h2 id="Type_parameters">Type parameters</h2>
<div id="Type_parameters_CONTENT">
<p>Unlike normal parameters, type parameters often come in piggybacked
on the actual value as &quot;kind&quot;, and you'd like a way to capture both
the value and its kind at once.  (A &quot;kind&quot; is a class or type that
an object is allowed to be.  An object is not officially allowed
to take on a constrained or contravariant type.)  A type variable
can be used anywhere a type name can, but instead of asserting that
the value must conform to a particular type, it captures the
actual &quot;kind&quot; of the object and also declares a package/type name
by which you can refer to that kind later in the signature or body.
For instance, if you wanted to match any two Dogs as long as they
were of the same kind, you can say:</p>
<pre>sub matchedset (Dog ::T $fido, T $spot) {...}
</pre>
<p>(Note that <code>::T</code> is not required to contain <code>Dog</code>, only
a type that is compatible with <code>Dog</code>.)</p>
<p>The <code>::</code> sigil is short for &quot;subset&quot; in much the same way that <code>&amp;</code> is
short for &quot;sub&quot;.  Just as <code>&amp;</code> can be used to name any kind of code,
so too <code>::</code> can be used to name any kind of type.  Both of them insert
a bare identifier into the symbol table, though they fill different syntactic
spots.</p>
<p>Note that it is not required to capture the object associated with the
class unless you want it.  The sub above could be written as</p>
<pre>sub matchedset (Dog ::T, T) {...}
</pre>
<p>if we're not interested in <code>$fido</code> or <code>$spot</code>.  Or just</p>
<pre>sub matchedset (::T, T) {...}

<pre>sub quicksort ([$pivot, *@data], $reverse?, $inplace?) {

<h2 id="Unpacking_tree_node_parameters">Unpacking tree node parameters</h2>
<div id="Unpacking_tree_node_parameters_CONTE">
<p>You can unpack hash values and tree nodes in various dwimmy ways by enclosing the bindings
of child nodes and attributes in parentheses following the declaration of
the node itself:</p>
<pre>sub traverse ( BinTree $top ( $left, $right ) ) {
    traverse($left);
    traverse($right);
}
</pre>
<p>In this, <code>$left</code> and <code>$right</code> are automatically bound to the left
and right nodes of the tree.  If <code>$top</code> is an ordinary object, it binds
the <code>$top.left</code> and <code>$top.right</code> attributes.  If it's a hash,
it binds <code>$top&lt;left&gt;</code> and <code>$top&lt;right&gt;</code>.  If <code>BinTree</code> is a
signature type and $top is a <code>Capture</code> (argument list) object, the child types
of the signature are applied to the actual arguments in the argument
list object.  (Signature types have the benefit that you can view
them inside-out as constructors with positional arguments, such that
the transformations can be reversible.)</p>
<p>However, the full power of signatures can be applied to pattern match
just about any argument or set of arguments, even though in some cases
the reverse transformation is not derivable.  For instance, to bind to
an array of children named <code>.kids</code> or <code>.&lt;kids&gt;</code>, use something
like:</p>
<pre>multi traverse ( NAry $top ( :kids [$eldest, *@siblings] ) ) {
    traverse($eldest);
    traverse(:kids(@siblings));  # (binds @siblings to $top)
}
multi traverse ( $leaf ) {...}
</pre>
<p>The second candidate is called only if the parameter cannot be bound to
both <code>$top</code> and to the &quot;kids&quot; parsing subparameter.</p>
<p>Likewise, to bind to a hash element of the node and then bind to
keys in that hash by name:</p>
<pre>sub traverse ( AttrNode $top ( :%attr{ :$vocalic, :$tense } ) ) {
    say &quot;Has {+%attr} attributes, of which&quot;;
    say &quot;vocalic = $vocalic&quot;;
    say &quot;tense = $tense&quot;;
}
</pre>
<p>You may omit the top variable if you prefix the parentheses with a colon
to indicate a signature.  Otherwise you must at least put the sigil of
the variable, or we can't correctly differentiate:</p>
<pre>my Dog ($fido, $spot)   := twodogs();       # list of two dogs
my Dog $ ($fido, $spot) := twodogs();       # one twodog object
my Dog :($fido, $spot)  := twodogs();       # one twodog object
</pre>
<p>Sub signatures can be matched directly within regexes by using <code>:(...)</code>
notation.</p>
<pre>push @a, &quot;foo&quot;;
push @a, \(1,2,3);
push @a, &quot;bar&quot;;
...
my ($i, $j, $k);
@a ~~ rx/
        &lt;,&gt;                         # match initial elem boundary
        :(Int $i,Int $j,Int? $k)    # match lists with 2 or 3 ints
        &lt;,&gt;                         # match final elem boundary
      /;
say &quot;i = $&lt;i&gt;&quot;;
say &quot;j = $&lt;j&gt;&quot;;
say &quot;k = $&lt;k&gt;&quot; if defined $&lt;k&gt;;
</pre>
<p>If you want a parameter bound into <code>$/</code>, you have to say <code>$&lt;i&gt;</code>
within the signature.  Otherwise it will try to bind an external <code>$i</code>
instead, and fail if no such variable is declared.</p>
<p>Note that unlike a sub declaration, a regex-embedded signature has no
associated &quot;returns&quot; syntactic slot, so you have to use <code>--&gt;</code>
within the signature to specify the <code>of</code> type of the signature, or match as
an arglist:</p>
<pre>:(Num, Num --&gt; Coord)
:(\Coord(Num, Num))
</pre>
<p>A consequence of the latter form is that you can match the type of
an object with <code>:(\Dog)</code> without actually breaking it into its components.
Note, however, that it's not equivalent to say</p>
<pre>:(--&gt; Dog)
</pre>
<p>which would be equivalent to</p>
<pre>:(\Dog())
</pre>
<p>that is, match a nullary function of type <code>Dog</code>.  Nor is it equivalent to</p>
<pre>:(Dog)
</pre>
<p>which would be equivalent to</p>
<pre>:(\Any(Dog))
</pre>
<p>and match a function taking a single parameter of type Dog.</p>
<p>Note also that bare <code>\(1,2,3)</code> is never legal in a regex since the
first (escaped) paren would try to match literally.</p>

<h2 id="Placeholder_variables">Placeholder variables</h2>
<div id="Placeholder_variables_CONTENT">
<p>Even though every bare block is a closure, bare blocks can't have
explicit parameter lists. Instead, they use &quot;placeholder&quot; variables,
marked by a caret (<code>^</code>) or a colon (<code>:</code>) after their sigils.
The caret marks positional placeholders, while the colon marks named
placeholders.</p>
<p>Using placeholders in a block defines an implicit parameter list. The
signature is the list of distinct positional placeholder names,
sorted in Unicode order, following by the named placeholder names in
any order.  So:</p>
<pre>{ say &quot;woof&quot; if $:dog; $^y &lt; $^z &amp;&amp; $^x != 2 }
</pre>
<p>is a shorthand for:</p>
<pre>-&gt; $x,$y,$z,:$dog { say &quot;woof&quot; if $dog; $y &lt; $z &amp;&amp; $x != 2 }
</pre>
<p>Note that placeholder variables syntactically cannot have type constraints.
Also, it is illegal to use placeholder variables in a block that already
has a signature, because the autogenerated signature would conflict with that.
Positional placeholder names consisting of a single uppercase letter are disallowed,
not because we're mean, but because it helps us catch references to
obsolete Perl 5 variables such as <code>$^O</code>.</p>
<p>A function containing placeholders may also refer to either <code>@_</code>
or <code>%_</code> or both, each of which (if so used) will be added to the
signature as a normal readonly slurpy pararmeter:</p>
<pre>{ say $:what; warn &quot;bad option: $_\n&quot; for keys %_; }
</pre>
<p>turns into</p>
<pre>-&gt; :$what, *%_ { say $what; warn &quot;bad option: $_\n&quot; for keys %_; }
</pre>
<p>If not used, they are not added, and a dispatch with mispatched parameters will fail.</p>
<p>Placeholders may also be used in method bodies that have no formal signature.</p>
<p>Since the placeholder declares a parameter variable without the twigil,
the twigil is needed only on the first occurrence of the variable within
the block.  Subsequent mentions of that variable may omit the twigil.
Within an internal nested block the twigil <i>must</i> be omitted, since
it would wrongly attach to the inner block.</p>

In the abstract, this cache is just a hash where incoming argument
<code>Capture</code>s are mapped to return values.  If the <code>Capture</code> is found in
the hash, the return value need not be recalculated.  If you use
this trait, the compiler will assume two things:</p>
		<p>
			<ul>
					<li><p>A given <code>Capture</code> would always calculate the same return value.  That is,
there is no state hidden within the dynamic scope of the call.				</p></li>
					<li><p>The cache lookup is likely to be more efficient than recalculating
the value in at least some cases, because either most uncached calls
would be slower (and reduce throughput), or you're trying to avoid a
significant number of pathological cases that are unacceptably slow
(and increase latency).</p></li>
</ul>

		</p>
		<p>This trait is a suggestion to the compiler that caching is okay.  The
compiler is free to choose any kind of caching algorithm (including
non-expiring, random, lru, pseudo-lru, or adaptive algoritms, or
even no caching algorithm at all).  The run-time system is free to
choose any kind of maximum cache size depending on the availability
of memory and trends in usage patterns.  You may suggest a particular
cache size by passing a numeric argument (representing the maximum number
of unique <code>Capture</code> values allowed), and some of the possible
algorithms may pay attention to it.  You may also pass <code>*</code> for the
size to request a non-expiring cache (complete memoization).  The
compiler is free to ignore this too.</p>
		<p>The intent of this trait is to specify performance hints without
mandating any exact behavior.  Proper use of this trait should not
change semantics of the program; it functions as a kind of &quot;pragma&quot;.
This trait will not be extended to reinvent other existing ways of
achieving the same effect.  To gain more control, write your own
trait handler to allow the use of a more specific trait, such as
&quot;<code>is lru(42)</code>&quot;.  Alternately, just use a state hash keyed on the
sub's argument capture to write your own memoization with complete
control from within the subroutine itself, or from within a wrapper
around your subroutine.</p>

	<dd>
		<p>Specifies the precedence of an operator relative to an existing

being left associative.  They define a new precedence level slighty
tighter or looser than the precedence level on which they're based.
Both <code>tighter</code> and <code>looser</code> may be specified, in which case the new
precedence level is generated midway between the specified levels.</p>
		<p>Two different declarations using the same precedence derivation end
up at the same precedence level, as if <code>equiv</code> was specified instead
of <code>tighter</code>/<code>looser</code>, and the second will clone the associativity
of the first.  If the second explicitly specifies an associativity
that differs from the first, unexpected parsing conflicts may result.
(See S03.)</p>
		<p>In addition to cloning the precedence level,
<code>equiv</code> also clones other traits, so it specifies
the default associativity to be the same as the operator to which
the new operator is equivalent.  The following are the default
equivalents for various syntactic categories if neither <code>equiv</code> nor
<code>assoc</code> is specified.  (Many of these have no need of precedence
or associativity because they are parsed specially.  Nevertheless,
<code>equiv</code> may be useful for cloning other traits of these operators.)</p>

requires multiple arguments defaults to listop precedence, even if it
is not an identifier:</p>
<pre>sub prefix:&lt;☎&gt; ($x,$y) {...}
☎ 1;                # ERROR, too few arguments
☎ 1, 2;             # okay
☎ 1, 2, 3;          # ERROR, too many arguments
</pre>
		<p>You must use the <code>prefix:&lt;foo&gt;</code> form in order to mutate
the grammar to parse as a named unary operator.  Normal function
definitions never change the grammar, and when called always parse
as listops, even if defined with a single argument:</p>
<pre>sub foo ($x) {...}  # a listop
foo(1), 2, 3;       # okay
(foo 1), 2, 3;      # okay
foo 1, 2, 3;        # ERROR, too many arguments
</pre>
		<p>Likewise 0-ary functions parse as listops.  Use <code>term:&lt;foo&gt;</code>
(or a constant or enum declaration) to declare a term that expects
no arguments.</p>

</pre>
		<p>Note that operators &quot;<code>equiv</code>&quot; to relationals are automatically considered
chaining operators.  When creating a new precedence level, the chaining
is determined by the presence or absence of &quot;<code>is assoc&lt;chain&gt;</code>&quot;,
and other operators defined at that level are required to be the same.</p>
		<p>Specifying an <code>assoc</code> without an explicit <code>equiv</code> substitutes a default
<code>equiv</code> consistent with the associativity, as shown in the final column above.</p>

		<p>When applied to a method, the semantics provide support for the

a particular method is met if all the <code>PRE</code> blocks associated

if <code>all</code> of the parent classes' preconditions are met (which may
include the preconditions of <i>their</i> parent classes if they fail,
and so on recursively.)</p>
		<p>In contrast, a method's postcondition is met if all the method's <code>POST</code> blocks
return true <i>and</i> all its parents' postconditions are also met recursively.</p>
		<p><code>POST</code> blocks (and &quot;<code>will post</code>&quot; block traits) declared within a <code>PRE</code>
or <code>ENTER</code> block are automatically hoisted outward to be called at the
same time as other <code>POST</code> blocks.  This conveniently gives &quot;circum&quot;
semantics by virtue of wrapping the post lexical scope within the pre
lexical scope.</p>
<pre>method push ($new_item) {

</div>
<h2 id="The_code_return_code_function">The <code>return</code> function</h2>
<div id="The_code_return_code_function_CONTEN">
<p>The <code>return</code> function notionally throws a control exception that is
caught by the current lexically enclosing <code>Routine</code> to force a return
through the control logic code of any intermediate block constructs.
(That is, it must unwind the stack of dynamic scopes to the proper
lexical scope belonging to this routine.)  With normal blocks
(those that are autoexecuted in place because they're known to the
compiler) this unwinding can likely be optimized away to a &quot;goto&quot;.
All <code>Routine</code> declarations have an explicit declarator such as <code>sub</code>
or <code>method</code>; bare blocks and &quot;pointy&quot; blocks are never considered
to be routines in that sense.  To return from a block, use <code>leave</code>
instead--see below.</p>
<p>The <code>return</code> function preserves its argument list as a <code>Capture</code> object, and
responds to the left-hand <code>Signature</code> in a binding.  This allows named return
values if the caller expects one:</p>
<pre>sub f () { return :x&lt;1&gt; }
sub g ($x) { print $x }

my $x := |(f);  # binds 1 to $x, via a named argument
g(|(f));        # prints 1, via a named argument
</pre>
<p>To return a literal <code>Pair</code> object, always put it in an additional set of
parentheses:</p>
<pre>return( (:x&lt;1&gt;), (:y&lt;2&gt;) ); # two positional Pair objects
</pre>
<p>Note that the postfix parentheses on the function call don't count as
being &quot;additional&quot;.  However, as with any function, whitespace after the
<code>return</code> keyword prevents that interpretation and turns it instead
into a list operator:</p>
<pre>return :x&lt;1&gt;, :y&lt;2&gt;; # two named arguments (if caller uses |)
return ( :x&lt;1&gt;, :y&lt;2&gt; ); # two positional Pair objects
</pre>
<p>If the function ends with an expression without an explicit <code>return</code>,
that expression is also taken to be a <code>Capture</code>, just as if the expression
were the argument to a <code>return</code> list operator (with whitespace):</p>
<pre>sub f { :x&lt;1&gt; } # named-argument binding (if caller uses |)
sub f { (:x&lt;1&gt;) } # always just one positional Pair object
</pre>
<p>On the caller's end, the <code>Capture</code> is interpolated into any new argument list
much like an array would be, that is, as an item in item context, and as a
list in list context.  This is the default behavior, but the
caller may use <code>prefix:&lt;|&gt;</code> to inline the returned values as part of the
new argument list.  The caller may also bind the returned <code>Capture</code> directly.</p>
<p>If any function called as part of a return list asks what its context
is, it will be told it was called in list context regardless of the
eventual binding of the returned <code>Capture</code>.  (This is quite
different from Perl 5, where a <code>return</code> statement always propagates its
caller's context to its own argument(s).)  If that is not the
desired behavior you must coerce the call to an appropriate context,
(or declare the return type of the function to perform such a coercion).
In any event, such a function is called only once at the time the
<code>Capture</code> object is generated, not when it is later bound (which
could happen more than once).</p>
</div>
<h2 id="The_code_context_code_and_code_calle">The <code>context</code> and <code>caller</code> functions</h2>
<div id="The_code_context_code_and_code_calle-2">
<p>The <code>context</code> function takes a list of matchers and interprets them
as a navigation path from the current context to a location in the
dynamic scope, either the current context itself or some context
from which the current context was called.  It returns an object
that describes that particular dynamic scope, or a false value if
there is no such scope.  Numeric arguments are interpreted as number
of contexts to skip, while non-numeric arguments scan outward for a
context matching the argument as a smartmatch.</p>
<p>The current context is accessed with a null argument list.</p>
<pre>say &quot; file &quot;, context().file,
    &quot; line &quot;, context().line;
</pre>
<p>which is equivalent to:</p>
<pre>say &quot; file &quot;, CONTEXT::&lt;$?FILE&gt;,
    &quot; line &quot;, CONTEXT::&lt;$?LINE&gt;;
</pre>
<p>The immediate caller of this context is accessed by skipping one level:</p>
<pre>say &quot; file &quot;, context(1).file,
    &quot; line &quot;, context(1).line;
</pre>
<p>You might think that that must be the current function's caller,
but that's not necessarily so.  This might return an outer block in
our own routine, or even some function elsewhere that implements a
control operator on behalf of our block.  To get outside your current
routine, see <code>caller</code> below.</p>
<p>The <code>context</code> function may be given arguments
telling it which higher scope to look for.  Each argument is processed
in order, left to right.  Note that <code>Any</code> and <code>0</code> are no-ops:</p>
<pre>$ctx = context();        # currently running context for &amp;?BLOCK
$ctx = context(Any);     # currently running context for &amp;?BLOCK
$ctx = context(Any,Any); # currently running context for &amp;?BLOCK
$ctx = context(1);       # my context's context
$ctx = context(2);       # my context's context's context
$ctx = context(3);       # my context's context's context's context
$ctx = context(1,0,1,1); # my context's context's context's context
$ctx = context($i);      # $i'th context
</pre>
<p>Note also that negative numbers are allowed as long as you stay within
the existing context stack:</p>
<pre>$ctx = context(4,-1);    # my context's context's context's context
</pre>
<p>Repeating any smartmatch just matches the same context again unless you
intersperse a 1 to skip the current level:</p>
<pre>$ctx = context(Method);              # nearest context that is method
$ctx = context(Method,Method);       # nearest context that is method
$ctx = context(Method,1,Method);     # 2nd nearest method context
$ctx = context(Method,1,Method,1)    # caller of that 2nd nearest method
$ctx = context(1,Block);             # nearest outer context that is block
$ctx = context(Sub,1,Sub,1,Sub);     # 3rd nearest sub context
$ctx = context({ .labels.any eq 'Foo' }); # nearest context labeled 'Foo'
</pre>
<p>Note that this last potentially differs from the answer returned by</p>
<pre>Foo.context
</pre>
<p>which returns the context of the innermost <code>Foo</code> block in the lexical scope
rather than the dynamic scope.  A context also responds to the <code>.context</code>
method, so a given context may be used as the basis for further navigation:</p>
<pre>$ctx = context(Method,1,Method);
$ctx = context(Method).context(1).context(Method);     # same
</pre>
<p>You must supply args to get anywhere else, since <code>.context</code> is
the identity operator when called on something that is already
a <code>Context</code>:</p>
<pre>$ctx = context;
$ctx = context.context.context.context;                # same
</pre>
<p>The <code>caller</code> function is special-cased to go outward just far enough
to escape from the current routine scope, after first ignoring any
inner blocks that are embedded, or are otherwise pretending to be &quot;inline&quot;:</p>
<pre>&amp;caller ::= &amp;context.assuming({ !.inline }, 1);
</pre>
<p>Note that this is usually the same as <code>context(&amp;?ROUTINE,1)</code>,
but not always.  A call to a returned closure might not even have
<code>&amp;?ROUTINE</code> in its dynamic scope anymore, but it still has a caller.</p>
<p>So to find where the current routine was called you can say:</p>
<pre>say &quot; file &quot;, caller.file,
    &quot; line &quot;, caller.line;
</pre>
<p>which is equivalent to:</p>
<pre>say &quot; file &quot;, CALLER::&lt;$?FILE&gt;,
    &quot; line &quot;, CALLER::&lt;$?LINE&gt;;
</pre>
<p>Additional arguments to <code>caller</code> are treated as navigational from the
calling context.  One context out from your current routine is <i>not</i>
guaranteed to be a <code>Routine</code> context.  You must say <code>caller(Routine)</code>
to get to the next-most-inner routine.</p>
<p>Note that <code>caller(Routine).line</code> is not necessarily going to give you the
line number that your current routine was called from; you're rather
likely to get the line number of the topmost block that is executing
within that outer routine, where that block contains the call to
your routine.</p>
<p>For either <code>context</code> or <code>caller</code>,
the returned context object supports at least the following methods:</p>
<pre>.context
.caller
.leave
.want
.inline
.package
.file
.line
.my
.hints
</pre>
<p>The <code>.context</code> and <code>.caller</code> methods work the same as the functions
except that they are relative to the context supplied as invocant.
The <code>.leave</code> method can force an immediate return from the
specified context.  The <code>.want</code> method returns known smart-matchable
characteristics of the specified context.</p>
<p>The <code>.inline</code> method says whether this block was entered implicitly
by some surrounding control structure.  Any time you invoke a block or
routine explicitly with <code>.()</code> this is false.  However, it is defined
to be true for any block entered using dispatcher-level primitives
such as <code>.callwith</code>, <code>.callsame</code>, <code>.nextwith</code>, or <code>.nextsame</code>.</p>
<p>The <code>.my</code> method provides access to the lexical namespace in effect at
the given dynamic context's current position.  It may be used to look
up ordinary lexical variables in that lexical scope.  It must not be
used to change any lexical variable that is not marked as <code>context&lt;rw&gt;</code>.</p>
<p>The <code>.hints</code> method gives access to a snapshot of compiler symbols in
effect at the point of the call when the call was originally compiled.
(For instance, <code>caller.hints('&amp;?ROUTINE')</code> will give you the caller's
routine object.)  Such values are always read-only, though in the
case of some (like the caller's routine above) may return a fixed
object that is nevertheless mutable.</p>
</div>
<h2 id="The_code_want_code_function">The <code>want</code> function</h2>
<div id="The_code_want_code_function_CONTENT">
<p>The <code>want</code> function returns a <code>Signature</code> object that contains
information about the context in which the current block, closure,
or subroutine was called.  The <code>want</code> function is really just
short for <code>caller.want</code>.  (Note that this is what your current
routine's caller wants from your routine, not necessarily the same as
<code>context.want</code> when you are embedded in a block within a subroutine.
Use <code>context.want</code> if that's what you want.)</p>
<p>As with normal function signatures, you can test the result of <code>want</code> with a
smart match (<code>~~</code>) or a <code>when</code>:</p>
<pre>   given want {
    when :($)       {...}   # called in item context
    when :(*@)      {...}   # called in list context
    when :($ is rw) {...}   # expected to return an lvalue
    when :($,$)     {...}   # expected to return two values
    ...
}
</pre>
<p>Or use its shorthand methods to reduce line noise:</p>
<pre>if    want.item      {...}  # called in non-lvalue item context
elsif want.list      {...}  # called in list context
elsif want.void      {...}  # called in void context
elsif want.rw        {...}  # expected to return an lvalue
</pre>
<p>The <code>.arity</code> and <code>.count</code> methods also work here:</p>
<pre>if want.arity &gt; 2    {...}  # must return more than two values
if want.count &gt; 2    {...}  # can return more than two values
</pre>
<p>Their difference is that <code>.arity</code> considers only mandatory parts,
while <code>.count</code> considers also optional ones, including <code>*$</code>:</p>
<pre>($x, $y) = f();     # Within &amp;f, want === :(*$?, *$?, *@)
                    #            want.arity === 0
                    #            want.count === 2
</pre>
</div>
<h2 id="The_code_leave_code_function">The <code>leave</code> function</h2>
<div id="The_code_leave_code_function_CONTENT">
<p>As mentioned above, a <code>return</code> call causes the innermost surrounding
subroutine, method, rule, token, regex (as a keyword) or macro
to return.  Only declarations with an explicit declarator keyword
(<code>sub</code>, <code>submethod</code>, <code>method</code>, <code>macro</code>, <code>regex</code>, <code>token</code>, and
<code>rule</code>) may be returned from.  Statement prefixes such a <code>do</code> and
<code>try</code> do not fall into that category.
You cannot use <code>return</code> to escape directly into the surrounding
context from loops, bare blocks, pointy blocks, or quotelike operators
such as <code>rx//</code>; a <code>return</code> within one of those constructs will
continue searching outward for a &quot;proper&quot; routine to return from.
Nor may you return from property blocks such as <code>BEGIN</code> or <code>CATCH</code>
(though blocks executing within the lexical and dynamic scope of a
routine can of course return from that outer routine, which means
you can always return from a <code>CATCH</code> or a <code>FIRST</code>, but never from
a <code>BEGIN</code> or <code>INIT</code>.)</p>
<p>To return from blocks that aren't routines, the <code>leave</code> method is used
instead.  (It can be taken to mean either &quot;go away from&quot; or &quot;bequeath
to your successor&quot; as appropriate.)  The object specifies the scope to exit,
and the method's arguments specify the return value.  If the object
is omitted (by use of the function or listop forms), the innermost
block is exited.  Otherwise you must use something like <code>context</code>
or <code>&amp;?BLOCK</code> or a contextual variable to specify the scope you
want to exit.  A label (such as a loop label) previously seen in
the lexical scope also works as a kind of singleton context object:
it names a statement that is serving both as an outer lexical scope
and as a context in the current dynamic scope.</p>
<p>As with <code>return</code>, the arguments are taken to be a <code>Capture</code> holding the
return values.</p>
<pre>leave;                      # return from innermost block of any kind
context(Method).leave;      # return from innermost calling method
&amp;?ROUTINE.leave(1,2,3);     # Return from current sub. Same as: return 1,2,3
&amp;?ROUTINE.leave &lt;== 1,2,3;  # same thing, force return as feed
OUTER.leave;                # Return from OUTER label in lexical scope
&amp;foo.leave: 1,2,3;          # Return from innermost surrounding call to &amp;foo
</pre>
<p>Note that these are equivalent in terms of control flow:</p>
<pre>COUNT.leave;
last COUNT;
</pre>
<p>However, the first form explicitly sets the return value for the
entire loop, while the second implicitly returns all the previous
successful loop iteration values as a list comprehension.  (It may,
in fact, be too late to set a return value for the loop if it is
being evaluated lazily!)  A <code>leave</code>
from the inner loop block, however, merely specifies the return value for
that iteration:</p>
<pre>for 1..10 { leave $_ * 2 }   # 2..20
</pre>
<p>Note that this:</p>
<pre>leave COUNT;
</pre>
<p>will always be taken as the function, not the method, so it returns
the <code>COUNT</code> object from the innermost block.  The indirect object form
of the method always requires a colon:</p>
<pre>leave COUNT: ;
</pre>
</div>
<h2 id="Temporization">Temporization</h2>
<div id="Temporization_CONTENT">
<p>The <code>temp</code> macro temporarily replaces the value of an existing
variable, subroutine, context of a function call, or other object in a given scope:</p>
<pre>{
   temp $*foo = 'foo';      # Temporarily replace global $foo
   temp &amp;bar := sub {...};  # Temporarily replace sub &amp;bar
   ...
} # Old values of $*foo and &amp;bar reinstated at this point
</pre>
<p><code>temp</code> invokes its argument's <code>.TEMP</code> method. The method is expected
to return a <code>Callable</code> object that can later restore the current
value of the object. At the end of the lexical scope in which the
<code>temp</code> was applied, the subroutine returned by the <code>.TEMP</code> method is
executed.</p>
<p>The default <code>.TEMP</code> method for variables simply creates
a closure that assigns the variable's pre-<code>temp</code> value
back to the variable.</p>
<p>New kinds of temporization can be created by writing storage classes with
their own <code>.TEMP</code> methods:</p>
<pre>class LoudArray is Array {
    method TEMP {
        print &quot;Replacing $.WHICH() at {caller.location}\n&quot;;
        my $restorer = $.SUPER::TEMP();
        return {
            print &quot;Restoring $.WHICH() at {caller.location}\n&quot;;
            $restorer();
        };
    }
}
</pre>
<p>You can also modify the behaviour of temporized code structures, by
giving them a <code>TEMP</code> block. As with <code>.TEMP</code> methods, this block is
expected to return a closure, which will be executed at the end of
the temporizing scope to restore the subroutine to its pre-<code>temp</code> state:</p>
<pre>my $next = 0;
sub next {
    my $curr = $next++;
    TEMP {{ $next = $curr }}  # TEMP block returns the closure { $next = $curr }
    return $curr;
}

# and later...

say next();     # prints 0; $next == 1
say next();     # prints 1; $next == 2
say next();     # prints 2; $next == 3
if ($hiccough) {
    say temp next();  # prints 3; closes $curr at 3; $next == 4
    say next();       # prints 4; $next == 5
    say next();       # prints 5; $next == 6
}                     # $next = 3
say next();     # prints 3; $next == 4
say next();     # prints 4; $next == 5
</pre>
<p>Note that <code>temp</code> must be a macro rather than a function because the
temporization must be arranged before the function causes any state
changes, and if it were a normal argument to a normal function, the state
change would be happen before <code>temp</code> got control.</p>
<p>Hypothetical variables use the same mechanism, except that the restoring
closure is called only on failure.</p>
<p>Note that contextual variables may be a better solution than temporized
globals in the face of multithreading.</p>

<p>The <code>callwith</code> function lets you pass your own arguments to the wrapped
function.  The <code>callsame</code> function takes no argument; it
implicitly passes the original argument list through unchanged.</p>
<p>The call to <code>.wrap</code> replaces the original <code>Routine</code>'s <code>do</code> property with the <code>Callable</code>
argument, and arranges that any call to <code>callsame</code>, <code>callwith</code>,
<code>nextsame</code> or <code>nextwith</code> invokes the previous version of the
routine. In other words, the call to <code>.wrap</code> has more or less the
same effect as:</p>
<pre>my &amp;old_thermo := &amp;thermo;
&amp;thermo = sub ($t) { old_thermo( ($t-32)/1.8 ) }
</pre>
<p>Note that <code>&amp;thermo.WHICH</code> stays the same after the <code>.wrap</code>,
as it does with the equivalent assignment shown since assignment
to a <code>Routine</code> works like a container, changing the contained <code>do</code>
property but not the container itself.</p>
<p>The call to <code>.wrap</code> returns a unique handle that has a <code>restore</code> method
that will undo the wrapping:</p>
<pre>$handle.restore;
</pre>
<p>This does not affect any other wrappings placed to the routine.</p>
<p>A wrapping can also be restricted to a particular dynamic scope with
temporization:</p>
<pre># Add a wrapper to convert from Kelvin
# wrapper self-unwraps at end of current scope
temp &amp;thermo.wrap( { callwith($^t + 273.16) } );
</pre>
<p>The entire argument list may be captured by binding to a <code>Capture</code> parameter.
It can then be passed to <code>callwith</code> using that name:</p>
<pre># Double the return value for &amp;thermo
&amp;thermo.wrap( -&gt; |$args { callwith(|$args) * 2 } );
</pre>
<p>In this case only the return value is changed.</p>
<p>The wrapper is not required to call the original routine; it can call another
<code>Callable</code> object by passing the <code>Capture</code> to its <code>callwith</code> method:</p>
<pre># Transparently redirect all calls to &amp;thermo to &amp;other_thermo
&amp;thermo.wrap( sub (|$args) { &amp;other_thermo.callwith(|$args) } );
</pre>
<p>or more briefly:</p>
<pre>&amp;thermo.wrap( { &amp;other_thermo.callsame } );
</pre>
<p>Since the method versions of <code>callsame</code>, <code>callwith</code>, <code>nextsame</code>,
and <code>nextwith</code> specify an explicit destination, their semantics do
not change outside of wrappers.  However, the corresponding functions
have no explicit destination, so instead they implicitly call the
next-most-likely method or multi-sub; see S12 for details.</p>
<p>As with any return value, you may capture the returned <code>Capture</code> of <code>call</code>
by binding:</p>
<pre>my |$retval := callwith(|$args);
... # postprocessing
return |$retval;
</pre>
<p>Alternately, you may prevent any return at all by using the variants
<code>nextsame</code> and <code>nextwith</code>.  Arguments are passed just as with
<code>callsame</code> and <code>callwith</code>, but a tail call is explicitly enforced;
any code following the call will be unreached, as if a return had
been executed there before calling into the destination routine.</p>
<p>Within an ordinary method dispatch these functions treat the rest
of the dispatcher's candidate list as the wrapped function, which
generally works out to calling the same method in one of our parent
(or older sibling) classes.  Likewise within a multiple dispatch the
current routine may defer to candidates further down the candidate
list.  Although not necessarily related by a class hierarchy, such
later candidates are considered more generic and hence likelier
to be able to handle various unforeseen conditions (perhaps).</p>

<h2 id="Macros">Macros</h2>
<div id="Macros_CONTENT">
<p>Macros are functions or operators that are called by the compiler as
soon as their arguments are parsed (if not sooner).  The syntactic
effect of a macro declaration or importation is always lexically
scoped, even if the name of the macro is visible elsewhere.  As with
ordinary operators, macros may be classified by their grammatical
category.  For a given grammatical category, a default parsing rule or
set of rules is used, but those rules that have not yet been &quot;used&quot;
by the time the macro keyword or token is seen can be replaced by
use of &quot;is parsed&quot; trait.  (This means, for instance, that an infix
operator can change the parse rules for its right operand but not
its left operand.)</p>
<p>In the absence of a signature to the contrary, a macro is called as
if it were a method on the current match object returned from the
grammar rule being reduced; that is, all the current parse information
is available by treating <code>self</code> as if it were a <code>$/</code> object.
[Conjecture: alternate representations may be available if arguments
are declared with particular AST types.]</p>
<p>Macros may return either a string to be reparsed, or a syntax tree
that needs no further parsing.  The textual form is handy, but the
syntax tree form is generally preferred because it allows the parser
and debugger to give better error messages.  Textual substitution
on the other hand tends to yield error messages that are opaque to
the user.  Syntax trees are also better in general because they are
reversible, so things like syntax highlighters can get back to the
original language and know which parts of the derived program come
from which parts of the user's view of the program.  Nevertheless,
it's difficult to return a syntax tree for an unbalanced construct,
and in such cases a textual macro may be a clearer expression of the
evil thing you're trying to do.</p>
<p>If you call a macro at runtime, the result of the macro is automatically
evaluated again, so the two calls below print the same thing:</p>
<pre>macro f { '1 + 1' }
say f();    # compile-time call to &amp;f
say &amp;f();   # runtime call to &amp;f
</pre>
</div>
<h2 id="Quasiquoting">Quasiquoting</h2>
<div id="Quasiquoting_CONTENT">
<p>In aid of returning syntax tree, Perl provides a &quot;quasiquoting&quot;
mechanism using the quote <code>quasi</code>, followed by a block intended to
represent an AST:</p>
<pre>return quasi { say &quot;foo&quot; };
</pre>
<p>Modifiers to the <code>quasi</code> can modify the operation:</p>
<pre>:ast(MyAst)         # Default :ast(AST)
:lang(Ruby)         # Default :lang($?PARSER)
:unquote&lt;[: :]&gt;     # Default &quot;triple rule&quot;
</pre>
<p>Within a quasiquote, variable and function names resolve according
to the lexical scope of the macro definition.  Unrecognized symbols raise
errors when the macro is being compiled, <i>not</i> when it's being used.</p>
<p>To make a symbol resolve to the (partially compiled) scope of the macro
call, use the <code>COMPILING::</code> pseudo-package:</p>
<pre>macro moose () { quasi { $COMPILING::x } }

moose(); # macro-call-time error
my $x;
moose(); # resolves to 'my $x'
</pre>
<p>If you want to mention symbols from the scope of the macro call, use the
import syntax as modifiers to <code>quasi</code>:</p>
<pre>:COMPILING&lt;$x&gt;      # $x always refers to $x in caller's scope
:COMPILING          # All free variables fallback to caller's scope
</pre>
<p>If those symbols do not exist in the scope of the compiling scope, a
compile-time exception is thrown at macro call time.</p>
<p>Similarly, in the macro body you may either refer to the <code>$x</code> declared in the
scope of the macro call as <code>$COMPILING::x</code>, or bind to them explicitly:</p>
<pre>my $x := $COMPILING::x;
</pre>
<p>You may also use an import list to bind multiple symbols into the
macro's lexical scope:</p>
<pre>require COMPILING &lt;$x $y $z&gt;;
</pre>
<p>Note that you need to use the run-time <code>:=</code> and <code>require</code> forms, not <code>::=</code>
and <code>use</code>, because the macro caller's compile-time is the macro's runtime.</p>
</div>
<h2 id="Splicing">Splicing</h2>
<div id="Splicing_CONTENT">
<p>Bare AST variables (such as the arguments to the macro) may not be
spliced directly into a quasiquote because they would be taken as
normal bindings.  Likewise, program text strings to be inserted need
to be specially marked or they will be bound normally.  To insert a
&quot;unquoted&quot; expression of either type within a quasiquote, use the
quasiquote delimiter tripled, typically a bracketing quote of some sort:</p>
<pre>return quasi { say $a + {{{ $ast }}} }
return quasi [ say $a + [[[ $ast ]]] ]
return quasi &lt; say $a + &lt;&lt;&lt; $ast &gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;
return quasi ( say $a + ((( $ast ))) )
</pre>
<p>The delimiters don't have to be bracketing quotes, but the following
is probably to be construed as Bad Style:</p>
<pre>return quasi / say $a + /// $ast /// /
</pre>
<p>(Note to implementors: this must not be implemented by finding
the final closing delimiter and preprocessing, or we'll violate our
one-pass parsing rule.  Perl 6 parsing rules are parameterized to know
their closing delimiter, so adding the opening delimiter should not
be a hardship.  Alternately the opening delimiter can be deduced from
the closing delimiter.  Writing a rule that looks for three opening
delimiters in a row should not be a problem.  It has to be a special
grammar rule, though, not a fixed token, since we need to be able to
nest code blocks with different delimiters.  Likewise when parsing the
inner expression, the inner parser subrule is parameterized to know that
<code>}}}</code> or whatever is its closing delimiter.)</p>
<p>Unquoted expressions are inserted appropriately depending on the
type of the variable, which may be either a syntax tree or a string.
(Again, syntax tree is preferred.)  The case is similar to that of a
macro called from within the quasiquote, insofar as reparsing only
happens with the string version of interpolation, except that such
a reparse happens at macro call time rather than macro definition
time, so its result cannot change the parser's expectations about
what follows the interpolated variable.</p>
<p>Hence, while the quasiquote itself is being parsed, the syntactic
interpolation of a unquoted expression into the quasiquote always
results in the expectation of an operator following the unquote.
(You must use a call to a submacro if you want to expect something
else.)  Of course, the macro definition as a whole can expect
whatever it likes afterwards, according to its syntactic category.
(Generally, a term expects a following postfix or infix operator,
and an operator expects a following term or prefix operator.  This
does not matter for textual macros, however, since the reparse of
the text determines subsequent expectations.)</p>
<p>Quasiquotes default to hygienic lexical scoping, just like closures.
The visibility of lexical variables is limited to the quasi expression
by default.  A variable declaration can be made externally visible using
the <code>COMPILING::</code> pseudo-package.  Individual variables can be made visible,
or all top-level variable declarations can be exposed using the
<code>quasi :COMPILING</code> form.</p>
<p>Both examples below will add <code>$new_variable</code> to the lexical scope of
the macro call:</p>
<pre>  quasi {  my $COMPILING::new_variable;   my $private_var; ... }
  quasi :COMPILING { my $new_variable; { my $private_var; ... } }
</pre>
<p>(Note that <code>:COMPILING</code> has additional effects described in <a href="#Macros">Macros</a>.)</p>

<p>Ordinarily a top-level Perl &quot;script&quot; just evaluates its anonymous
mainline code and exits.  During the mainline code, the program's
arguments are available in raw form from the <code>@*ARGS</code> array.  At the end of
the mainline code, however, a <code>MAIN</code> subroutine will be called with
whatever command-line arguments remain in <code>@*ARGS</code>.  This call is
performed if and only if:</p>
<dl>

<p>The command line arguments (or what's left of them after mainline

<p>This form is allowed only for simple subs named <code>MAIN</code> that are intended
to be run from the command line.
Proto or multi definitions may not be written in semicolon form,
nor may <code>MAIN</code> subs within a module or class.  (A <code>MAIN</code> routine
is allowed in a module or class, but is not usually invoked unless
the file is run directly (see a above).  This corresponds to the
&quot;unless caller&quot; idiom of Perl 5.)  In general, you may have only one
semicolon-style declaration that controls the whole file.</p>
<p>If an attempted dispatch to <code>MAIN</code> fails, the <code>USAGE</code> routine is called.
If there is no <code>USAGE</code> routine, a default message is printed.  This
usage message is automatically generated from the signature (or

':name(42)'                :name(42)
</pre>
<p>For security reasons, only constants are allowed as arguments, however.</p>
<p>The default <code>Capture</code> mapper pays attention to declaration of <code>MAIN</code>'s
parameters to resolve certain ambiguities.  A <code>--foo</code> switch needs to
know whether to treat the next word from the command line as an argument.
(Allowing the spacey form gives the shell room to do various things to
the argument.)  The short <code>-foo</code> form never assumes a separate argument,
and you must use <code>=</code>.  For the <code>--foo</code> form, if there is a named parameter
corresponding to the switch name, and it is of type <code>Bool</code>, then no argument
is expected.  Otherwise an argument is expected.  If the parameter is of
a non-slurpy array type, all subsequent words up to the next command-line
switch (or the end of the list) are bound to that parameter.</p>
<p>As usual, switches are assumed to be first, and everything after
the first non-switch, or any switches after a <code>--</code>, are treated
as positionals or go into the slurpy array (even if they look like
switches).  Other policies may easily be introduced by calling <code>MAIN</code>
explicitly.  For instance, you can parse your arguments with a grammar
and pass the resulting <code>Match</code> object as a <code>Capture</code> to <code>MAIN</code>:</p>
<pre>@*ARGS ~~ /&lt;MyGrammar::top&gt;/;
MAIN(|$/);
exit;

sub MAIN ($frompart, $topart, *@rest) {
    if $frompart&lt;foo&gt; { ... }
    if $topart&lt;bar&gt;&lt;baz&gt; { ... }
}
</pre>
<p>This will conveniently bind top-level named matches to named
parameters, but still give you access to nested matches through those
parameters, just as any <code>Match</code> object would.  Of course, in this example,
there's no particular reason the sub has to be named <code>MAIN</code>.</p>
<p>To give both a long and a short switch name, you may use the pair
notation.  The key will be considered the short switch name, while
the variable name will be considered the long switch name.  So if
the previous declaration had been:</p>
<pre>sub MAIN (:f($frompart), :t($topart), *@rest)
</pre>
<p>then you could invoke the program with either <code>-f</code> or <code>--frompart</code>
to specify the first parameter.  Likewise you could use either <code>-t</code>
or <code>--topart</code> for the second parameter.</p>
<p>If a switch of the form <code>-abc</code> cannot be matched against any
particular parameter, an attempt will be made to match it as if it
had been written <code>-a -b -c</code>.</p>

<h2 id="Relationship_of_MAIN_routine_with_le">Relationship of MAIN routine with lexical setting</h2>
<div id="Relationship_of_MAIN_routine_with_le-2">
<p>The preceding section describes the use of <code>MAIN</code> in the user's code.
There may also be an implicit <code>MAIN</code> routine supplied by the setting
of the current compilation unit.  (The <code>-n</code> and <code>-p</code> command-line
switches are implemented this way.)  In this case the user's mainline
code is not automatically executed; instead, execution is controlled
by the setting's <code>MAIN</code> routine.  That routine calls <code>YOU_ARE_HERE</code>
at the point where the user's code is to be lexically inserted (in
the abstract).  A setting may also call <code>YOU_ARE_HERE</code> outside of
a <code>MAIN</code> routine, in which case it functions as a normal setting,
and the <code>YOU_ARE_HERE</code> merely indicates where the user's code
goes logically.  (Or from the compiler's point of view, which the
lexical scope to dump a snapshot of for later use by the compiler
as the setting for a different compilation unit.)  In this case the
execution of the user code proceeds as normal.  In fact, the <code>CORE</code>
setting ends with a <code>YOU_ARE_HERE</code> to dump the <code>CORE</code> lexical
scope as the standard setting.  In this sense, <code>CORE</code> functions as
an ordinary prelude.</p>
<p>If a <code>MAIN</code> routine is declared both in the setting and in the
user's code, the setting's <code>MAIN</code> functions as the actual mainline
entry point.  The user's <code>MAIN</code> functions in an embedded fashion;
the setting's invocation of <code>YOU_ARE_HERE</code> functions as the main
invocation from the point of view of the user's code, and the
user's <code>MAIN</code> routine will be invoked at the end of each call to
<code>YOU_ARE_HERE</code>.</p>

<h2 id="Implementation_note_on_autothreading">Implementation note on autothreading of only subs</h2>
<div id="Implementation_note_on_autothreading-2">
<p>The natural way to implement autothreading for multi subs is to
simply have the junctional signatures (the ones that can accept
<code>Object</code>s or junctions as well as <code>Any</code> parameters) match more loosely than
the non-autothreading versions, and let multiple dispatch find the
appropriate sub based on the signature.  Those generic routines
then end up redispatching to the more specific ones.</p>
<p>On the other hand, the natural implementation of only subs is to
call the sub in question directly for efficiency (and maybe even
inline it in some cases).  That efficiency is, after all, the main
reason for not just making all subs multi.  However, this direct
call conflicts with the desire to allow autothreading.  It might
be tempting to simply make everything multi dispatch underneath,
and then say that the &quot;only&quot; declaration merely means that you get
an error if you redeclare.  And maybe that is a valid approach if
the multiple dispatch mechanism is fast enough.</p>
<p>However, a direct call still needs to bind its arguments to its
parameters correctly, and it has to handle the case of failure to
bind somehow.  So it is also possible to implement autothreading
of only subs based on failover from the binding failure.  This could
either be a one-shot failover followed by a conversion to a multi call,
or it could failover every time you try to autothread. If we assume
that junctional processing is likely to be fairly heavyweight most of
the time compared to the cost of failing to bind, that tends to argue
for failing over every time.  This is also more conducive to inlining,
since it's difficult to rewrite inlined calls.</p>
