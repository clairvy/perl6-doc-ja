<p>This is a draft document. Many of these functions will work as in Perl
5, except we're trying to rationalize everything into roles.  For
now you can assume most of the important functions will automatically
be in the * namespace.  However, with IO operations in particular,
many of them are really methods on an IO handle, and if there is a
corresponding global function, it's merely an exported version of
the method.</p>

<h2 id="Overridable_IO_handles">Overridable IO handles</h2>
<div id="Overridable_IO_handles_CONTENT">
<p>In Perl 6, there are the <i>standard</i> IO handles, and any number of overriding
inner filehandles for the same symbol.</p>
<p>The <i>standard</i> handles are our old familiar friends (with new names).
Standard input changed from STDIN to <code>$*IN</code>, standard output changed
from STDOUT to <code>$*OUT</code>, and standard error changed from STDERR to
<code>$*ERR</code>.  In Perl 6 these symbols represent more of a concept than
a given filehandle, since the meaning is contextually determined.
The process's version of these handles live in the <code>PROCESS::</code>
namespace, which is more global than the per-interpreter <code>GLOBAL::</code>
namespace.</p>
<p>When no explicit filehandle is used, the standard IO operators are
defined in terms of the contextual variables.  So the <code>print</code> function
prints to <code>$*OUT</code>, while <code>warn</code> warns to <code>$*ERR</code>.  The <code>lines()</code>
term inputs from <code>$*ARGFILES</code> which defaults to <code>$*IN</code> in the absence of any
filenames.  So any given dynamic scope (interpreter,
thread, function or method call) may redefine the current meaning of
any of those filehandles within the dynamic scope of itself and of
its called routines.</p>
<p>So to put it another way, when you write something like</p>
<pre>say &quot;Howdy, world!&quot;
</pre>
<p>the <code>say</code> function looks for the current meaning of <code>$*OUT</code>, and
takes the closest definition it can find in its callers.  If none
of the callers have overridden the definition, it looks in the
interpreter's <code>GLOBAL</code> namespace.  If the interpreter hasn't overridden
the meaning, it takes the meaning from <code>PROCESS</code>.  In essence, any
dynamic scope in Perl 6 is allowed to do IO redirection much like
a Unix shell does with its subprocesses, albeit with a different
syntax:</p>
<pre>{
    temp $*OUT = open $newfile, :w;
    foo() # all stdout goes to $newfile
}
# stdout reverts to outer scope's definition
