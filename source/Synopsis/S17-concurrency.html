<p>This draft document is a paste together from various sources.  The bulk of it is simply
the old S17-concurrency.pod, which dealt only with concurrency.  Signals were added from
S16-io, but haven't been merged with the conflicting S17 signals doco.  An event loop
section has been added here because a) Larry mentioned the idea, and b) Moritz suggested
that http://www.seas.upenn.edu/~lipeng/homepage/unify.html be our model for concurrency,
and in that model, an event loop underlies the threads.</p>
</div>
<h1 id="Overview">Overview</h1>
<div id="Overview_CONTENT">
<p>An event loop underlies everything in this document.  POSIX signals can interact with
this, and concurrency is built on top of it.  Naturally, IPC (inter-process communication)
is documented here too (XXX or should be :) ).</p>

    has $blocked;   # Is this signal blocked?  cf. sigprocmask
}
</pre>
<p>The @*SIGQUEUE array contains a queue of the signals that are blocked and queued.</p>
<p>The standard POSIX signals simply raise control exceptions that are handled as normal
through the control signal handler, and caught by CONTROL blocks, as specified in S04.</p>

<p>See <cite>S04-control</cite> for details on how to handle exceptions.</p>
<p>XXX I'm unsure how the actions in the table above can be made to make sense.  The Ign
actions are already dealt with because %SIG{CHLD}.exception already defaults to undef.
The Term action will probably be self-solving (ie. will terminate the process).  The
others I'm just plain unsure about.  XXX</p>
</div>
<h1 id="Alarm">Alarm</h1>
<div id="Alarm_CONTENT">
<p>XXX Everything about Alarm is from the old S17-concurrency.pod</p>
<p>An alarm is just a pre-arranged exception to be delivered to your program.</p>
<p>By the time alarm has arrived, the current block may have already finished
executing, so you would need to set up CATCH blocks in places where an alarm
can rise to handle it properly.</p>
<p>You can request an alarm using the number of seconds, or with a target date.
It returns a proxy alarm object that you can do interesting things with.</p>
<pre>multi Alarm *alarm (Num $seconds = $CALLER::_, &amp;do = {die Sig::ALARM}, :$repeat = 1)
multi Alarm *alarm (Date $date, &amp;do = {die Sig::ALARM}, :$repeat = 1)
</pre>
<p>Perl 6's <code>alarm</code> has three additional features over traditional alarms:</p>
</div>
<h2 id="Multiple_and_Lexical_Alarms">Multiple and Lexical Alarms</h2>
<div id="Multiple_and_Lexical_Alarms_CONTENT">
<p>One can set up multiple alarms using repeated alarm calls:</p>
<pre>{
    my $a1 = alarm(2);
    my $a2 = alarm(2);
    sleep 10;
    CATCH {
        is critical; # if you don't want $a2 to be raised inside this
        when Sig::ALARM { ... }
    }
}
</pre>
<p>To stop an alarm, call <code>$alarm.stop</code>.  The <code>alarms</code> method for Conc objects
(including process and threads) returns a list of alarms currently scheduled
for that concurrent context.</p>
<p>When an alarm object is garbage collected, the alarm is stopped automatically.
Under void context, the implicit alarm object can only be stopped by querying
<code>.alarms</code> on the current process.</p>
<p>We are not sure what <code>alarm(0)</code> would mean.  Probably a deprecation warning?</p>
</div>
<h2 id="Repeated_Alarms">Repeated Alarms</h2>
<div id="Repeated_Alarms_CONTENT">
<p>If you request a repeated alarm using the <code>repeated</code> named argument, it will
attempt to fire off the alarm that many times.  However, the alarm will be
suppressed when inside a <code>CATCH</code> block that's already handling the exception
raised by <i>same</i> alarm.</p>
<p>To repeat 0 times is to not fire off any alarms at all.  To repeat +Inf times
is to repeat over and over again.</p>
</div>
<h2 id="Callbacks_in_Alarms">Callbacks in Alarms</h2>
<div id="Callbacks_in_Alarms_CONTENT">
<p>You can arrange a callback (like JavaScript's setTimeOut) in <code>alarm</code>, which
will then be invoked with the then-current code as caller.</p>
<p>If you set up such a callback to another Conc object, what happens is just like
when you called <code>.die</code> on behalf of that object -- namely, the callback
closure, along with anything it referenced, is shared to the target Conc
context.</p>
<p>Unlike in Perl 5's ithreads where you cannot share anything after the fact,
this allows passing shared objects in an <code>ad-hoc</code> fashion across concurrent
parts of the program.  Under the default (multiplexing) concurrency model, this
is basically a no-op.</p>

<div id="Concurrency_CONTENT">
<p>This is a draft document. After being some time under the surface of Perl 6
development this is a attempt to document working concurrency issues, list the
remaining todos and mark the probably obsolete and redundant points.</p>
</div>
<h2 id="Overview-2">Overview</h2>
<div id="Overview_CONTENT-2">
<p>Concurrency can take many forms in Perl 6.  With varying degrees of
explicitness and control capabilities.  This document attempts to describe
what these capabilities are and in which form they can be accessed in Perl 6.</p>
</div>
<h3 id="Processes_threads_fibers">Processes, threads, fibers?</h3>
<div id="Processes_threads_fibers_CONTENT">
<p>Concurrency comes in many shapes and forms.  Most Perl users are used to
the concept of a &quot;process&quot; or a &quot;thread&quot; (usually depending on the OS they
work on).  Some systems even are familiar with very lightweight threads
called &quot;fibers&quot;.</p>
<p>When discussing issues about concurrency with different people, it soon
becomes apparent that everybody has his own set of &quot;understandings&quot; about
what each word means, which doesn't make it any easier to describe
Perl 6 concurrency.</p>
<p>It seemed the most natural to use the word &quot;thread&quot; to describe a process
which has its own context, but also shares context with 0 or more
concurrently running processes.  Depending on your OS, or even specific
version of your OS, this could still be a single &quot;process&quot; from the OS's
point of view.  Or it could contain an OS process for each thread.  Or
any mixture of these two implementations.</p>
<p>In this document we try to be agnostic about this: all we know in Perl 6
are &quot;threads&quot;, which have their own context and share context with other
concurrently running &quot;threads&quot;.  Whether they be process, threads or fibres
at the OS level should not matter at the Perl 6 level.</p>
<p>And for sake of consistency, an unthreaded &quot;normal&quot; program is considered
to be also running in a single thread.</p>
</div>
<h3 id="Variables">Variables</h3>
<div id="Variables_CONTENT">
<p>In the past, there have been two models for concurrent processes in Perl.
In general, these are referred to as &quot;5.005 threads&quot; (<code>perldoc perlothrtut</code>)
and &quot;ithreads&quot; (<code>perldoc perlthrtut</code>).</p>
<p>The main difference between these two models from a programmer's point of
view, is that variables in &quot;5.005 threads&quot; are shared by default.  Whereas
in the &quot;ithreads&quot; model, only variables that have been indicated to be
&quot;shared&quot;, are actually shared between threads.  All other variable values
are actually copies of the variable's value in the &quot;parent&quot; thread.</p>
<p>With regards to variables, the concurrency model of Perl 6 is closer to the
&quot;5.005 threads&quot; model than it is to the &quot;ithreads&quot; model.  In fact, all
variables &quot;visible&quot; to a particular scope in Perl 6 will be accessible and
modifiable (if allowed to do so) from all of the concurrent processes that
start from that scope.  In that sense, one could consider the &quot;ithreads&quot;
model as a historical diversion: the Perl 6 concurrency picks up where the
&quot;5.005 threads&quot; path left off.</p>
<p>(EM: maybe point out that the &quot;ithreads&quot; behaviour can be simulated with
some kind of copy-on-write magic to be automagically added to all variable
access inside a thread, except for those with an explicit &quot;is shared&quot;
attribute?)</p>
</div>
<h2 id="Contend_Maybe_Defer">Contend/Maybe/Defer</h2>
<div id="Contend_Maybe_Defer_CONTENT">
</div>
<h3 id="No_user_accessible_locks">No user accessible locks</h3>
<div id="No_user_accessible_locks_CONTENT">
<p>Differently from any current concurrent process implementation in Perl, there
are no user accessible locks.  Instead, the concept of Software
Transactional Memory is used.  This is in concept similar to the use of</p>
<pre> BEGIN TRANSACTION
 ... do your uninterruptible actions
 COMMIT
</pre>
<p>in the database world.  More interestingly, this also includes the concept of
rollback:</p>
<pre> BEGIN TRANSACTION
 ... do your stuff, but impossible to complete: ROLLBACK
</pre>
<p>This causes the state of the process to be reverted to the state at the moment
the BEGIN TRANSACTION was executed.</p>
<p>Perl 6 supports this concept through <code>contend</code> blocks.</p>
<p>These sections are guaranteed to either be completed totally (when the Code
block is exited), or have their state reverted to the state at the start of
the Code block (with the <cite>defer</cite> statement).</p>
<p>(EM: maybe point out if / how old style locks can be &quot;simulated&quot;, for those
needing a migration path?)</p>
</div>
<h3 id="Atomic_Code_blocks">Atomic Code blocks</h3>
<div id="Atomic_Code_blocks_CONTENT">
<pre>my ($x, $y);
sub c {
    $x -= 3; $y += 3;
    $x &lt; 10 or defer;
}
sub d {
    $x += 3; $y -= 3;
    $y &lt; 10 or defer;
}

contend {
    # ...
    maybe { c() } maybe { d() };
    # ...
}
</pre>
<p>A Code block can be prefixed with <code>contend</code>.  This means that code executed
inside that scope is guaranteed not to be interrupted in any way.</p>
<p>The start of a block marked <code>contend</code> also becomes a <i>checkpoint</i> to
which execution can return (in exactly the same state) if a problem occurs
(a.k.a. a <cite>defer</cite> is done) inside the scope of the Code block.</p>
</div>
<h4 id="defer">defer</h4>
<div id="defer_CONTENT">
<p>The <code>defer</code> function basically restores the state of the thread at the
last checkpoint and will wait there until an external event allows it to
potentially run that atomic <code>contend</code> section of code again without having
to defer again.</p>
<p>If there are no external events possible that could restart execution, an
exception will be raised.</p>
<p>The last checkpoint is either the outermost <code>contend</code> boundary, or
the most immediate caller constructed with <code>maybe</code>.</p>
</div>
<h4 id="maybe">maybe</h4>
<div id="maybe_CONTENT">
<p>The <code>maybe</code> statement causes a checkpoint to be made for <code>defer</code> for
each block in the <code>maybe</code> chain, creating an alternate execution path to
be followed when a <code>defer</code> is done.  For example:</p>
<pre>maybe {
    ...
    some_condition() or defer;
    ...
} maybe {
    ...
    some_other_condition() or defer;
    ...
} maybe {
    ...
}
</pre>
<p>If placed outside a <code>contend</code> block, the <code>maybe</code> statement creates its
own <code>contend</code> barrier.</p>
</div>
<h4 id="limitations">limitations</h4>
<div id="limitations_CONTENT">
<p>Because Perl 6 must be able to revert its state to the state it had at the
checkpoint, it is not allowed to perform any non-revertible actions.  These
would include reading / writing from file handles that do not support
<code>seek</code> (such as sockets).  Attempting to do so will cause a fatal error
to occur.</p>
<p>This will probably need to be expanded to all objects: any object that has
some interface with data &quot;outside&quot; of the knowledge of the language (e.g. an
interface with an external XML library) would also need to provide some
method for freezing a state, and restoring to a previously frozen state.</p>
<p>If you're not interested in revertability, but are interested in
uninterruptability, you could use the &quot;is critical&quot; trait.</p>
</div>
<h4 id="Critical_Code_blocks">Critical Code blocks</h4>
<div id="Critical_Code_blocks_CONTENT">
<pre> sub tricky is critical {
 # code accessing external info, not to be interrupted
 }

 if ($update) {
 is critical;
 # code accessing external info, not to be interrupted
 }
</pre>
<p>A Code block marked &quot;is critical&quot; can not be interrupted in any way.  But
since it is able to access non-revertible data structures (such as
non-seekable file handles), it cannot do a <code>defer</code> as it would be impossible
to restore the state to the beginning of the Code block.</p>
</div>
<h4 id="Mixing_Atomic_and_Critical">Mixing Atomic and Critical</h4>
<div id="Mixing_Atomic_and_Critical_CONTENT">
<p>Both &quot;atomic&quot; as well as &quot;critical&quot; propagate down the call chain.  This means
that any subroutine that in itself is not &quot;atomic&quot; or &quot;critical&quot; becomes
uninterruptible if called inside a code block that is marked as &quot;atomic&quot; or
&quot;critical&quot;.</p>
<p>Atomic Code blocks called inside the call chain of a &quot;critical&quot; code block
do not pose a problem, as they are more restrictive.</p>
<p>Any code that attempts to perform any non-revertible action (e.g. reading
from a socket) will cause a fatal error when called inside the call chain
of an Atomic Code block.</p>
