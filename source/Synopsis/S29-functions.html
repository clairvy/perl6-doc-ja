<p>The document is a draft.</p>
<p>If you read the HTML version, it is generated from the pod in the pugs
repository under /docs/Perl6/Spec/S29-functions.pod so edit it there in
the SVN repository if you would like to make changes.</p>

<div id="Notes_CONTENT">
<p>In Perl 6, all builtin functions belong to a named package (generally a
class or role). Not all
functions are guaranteed to be imported into the CORE scope.
In addition, the list of functions imported into <code>CORE</code> will be
subject to change with each release of Perl. Authors wishing to
&quot;Future Proof&quot; their code should either specifically import the
functions they will be using, or always refer to the functions by their
full name.</p>
<p>After 6.0.0 comes out, global aliases will not be removed lightly,
and will never be removed at all without having gone through a
deprecation cycle of at least a year.  In any event, you can specify
that you want the interface for a particular version of Perl, and
that can be emulated by later versions of Perl to the extent that
security updates allow.</p>
<p>Where code is given here, it is intended to define semantics, not to
dictate implementation.</p>
</div>
<h2 id="Operators_vs_Functions">Operators vs. Functions</h2>
<div id="Operators_vs_Functions_CONTENT">
<p>There is no particular difference between an operator and a function,
but for the sake of documentation, only functions declared without
specifying a grammatical category or with a category of <code>term:</code>
(see <b>&quot;Bits and Pieces&quot;</b> in <cite>S02</cite>) will be described as &quot;functions&quot;,
and everything else as &quot;operators&quot; which are outside of the scope
of this document.  (See S03 for operators.)</p>
</div>
<h2 id="Multis_vs_Functions">Multis vs. Functions</h2>
<div id="Multis_vs_Functions_CONTENT">
<p>In actual fact, most of the &quot;functions&quot; defined here are multi
subs, or are multi methods that are also exported as multi subs.
The Setting is responsible for importing all the standard multi subs
from their various packages into the CORE lexical scope.  See S02.</p>
</div>
<h1 id="Type_Declarations">Type Declarations</h1>
<div id="Type_Declarations_CONTENT">
<p>The following type declarations are assumed:</p>
<dl>
	<dt>AnyChar</dt>
	<dd>
		<p>The root class of all &quot;character&quot; types, regardless of level.</p>
		<p>This is a subtype of <code>Str</code>, limited to a length of 1 at it's highest
supported Unicode level.</p>
		<p>The type name <code>Char</code> is aliased to the maximum supported Unicode level
in the current lexical scope (where &quot;current&quot; is taken to mean the
eventual lexical scope for generic code (roles and macros), not the
scope in which the generic code is defined).  In other words, use <code>Char</code>
when you don't care which level you're writing for.</p>
		<p>Subclasses (things that are <code>isa AnyChar</code>):</p>
		<p>
			<dl>
				<dt>CharLingua (language-defined characters)</dt>
				<dt>Grapheme (language-independent graphemes)</dt>
				<dt>Codepoint</dt>
				<dt>Byte</dt>
				<dd>
					<p>Yes, Byte is both a string and a number.</p>
				</dd>
			</dl>
		</p>
		<p>The short name for <code>Grapheme</code> is typically <code>Char</code> since that's the
default Unicode level.  A grapheme is defined as a base codepoint plus
any subsequent &quot;combining&quot; codepoints that apply to that base codepoint.
Graphemes are always assigned a unique integer id which, in the case of
a grapheme that has a precomposed codepoint, happens to be the same as
that codepoint.</p>
		<p>There is no short name for <code>CharLingua</code> because the type is meaningless
outside the scope of a particular language declaration.  In fact,
<code>CharLingua</code> is itself an abstract type that cannot be instantiated.
Instead you have names like <code>CharFrench</code>, <code>CharJapanese</code>,
<code>CharTurkish</code>, etc. for instantiated <code>CharLingua</code> types.
(Plus the corresponding <code>StrLingua</code> types, presumably.)</p>
	</dd>
	<dt>Matcher</dt>
	<dd>
<pre> subset Matcher of Object where { $_.can('ACCEPTS') };
</pre>
		<p>Used to supply a test to match against. Assume <code>~~</code> will be used against it.</p>
	</dd>
	<dt>Ordering</dt>
	<dd>
<pre> subset KeyExtractor of Code where { .signature === :(Any --&gt; Any) };
 subset Comparator   of Code where { .signature === :(Any, Any --&gt; Int ) };
 subset OrderingPair of Pair where { .left ~~ KeyExtractor &amp;&amp; .right ~~ Comparator };

 subset Ordering where Signature | KeyExtractor | Comparator | OrderingPair | Whatever;
</pre>
		<p>Used to handle comparisons between things.  Generally this
ends up in functions like <code>cmp()</code>, <code>eqv()</code>, <code>sort()</code>,
<code>min()</code>, <code>max()</code>, etc., as a $by parameter which provides
the information on how two things compare relative to each other.</p>
		<p>Note that <code>eqv()</code> and <code>cmp()</code> do almost but not the same thing
since with <code>eqv()</code> you don't care if two things are ordered
increasing or decreasing but only if they are the same or not.
Rather than declare an <code>Equiving</code> type declaration <code>Ordering</code> will
just do double duty.</p>
		<p>
			<dl>
				<dt>Comparator</dt>
				<dd>
					<p>A closure with arity of 2, which for ordering returns
negative/zero/positive, signaling the first argument should
be before/tied with/after the second. aka &quot;The Perl 5 way&quot;.</p>
					<p>For equivalence the closure returns either not 0 or 0 indicating
if the first argument is equivalent or not to the second.</p>
				</dd>
				<dt>KeyExtractor</dt>
				<dd>
					<p>A closure with arity of 1, which returns the &quot;key&quot; by which
to compare.  Values are compared using <code>cmp</code> for orderings
and <code>eqv</code> for equivalences, which in Perl 6 do different
comparisons depending on the types.  (To get a Perl 5 string
ordering you must compare with <code>leg</code> instead.)</p>
					<p>Internally the result of the KeyExtractor on a value should
be cached.</p>
					<p>Note that it is very easy to generate a simple <code>KeyExtractor</code>
using <code>~*</code> for strings and <code>+*</code> for numbers, since with most
simple operators <code>*</code> returns a closure of one argument.</p>
<pre>@sorted = sort +*, @unsorted;  #ascending numeric
@sorted = sort -*, @unsorted;  #descending numeric
</pre>
				</dd>
				<dt>OrderingPair</dt>
				<dd>
					<p>A combination of the two methods above, for when one wishes
to take advantage of the internal caching of keys that is
expected to happen, but wishes to compare them with something
other than <code>eqv</code> or <code>cmp</code>, such as <code>&lt;=&gt;</code> or <code>leg</code>.</p>
				</dd>
				<dt>Signature</dt>
				<dd>
					<p>If a signature is specified as a criterion, the signature is
bound to each value and then each parameter does comparisons
in positional order according to its type, as modified by
its traits.  Basically, the system will write the body of
the key extraction and comparison subroutine for you based on
the signature.</p>
					<p>For ordering the list of positional parameter comparisons is
reduced as if using [||] but all comparisons do not need to be
performed if an early one determines an increasing or decreasing
order.  For equivalence the list is reduced as if using [&amp;&amp;].</p>
				</dd>
				<dt>Whatever</dt>
				<dd>
					<p>An ordering of <code>*</code> does the default comparison for the operator:</p>
<pre>@sorted = sort *, @unsorted;

		<p>Calling <code>bless</code> on any invocant (but typically a type object) to create a new
object with the same class as the invocant.</p>
		<p><code>$candidate</code> is used to provide the underlying representation of the object.
The default is <code>P6opaque</code>, but various other representations might be
desired, especially when interoperating with other languages. <code>@protos</code> and
<code>%init_args</code> both provide ways for values to be provided to the new
object, just like in the default <code>new</code> method.</p>
		<p><code>bless</code> automatically calls all appropriate <code>BUILD</code> routines by calling the
<code>BUILDALL</code> routine for the current class, which initializes the object in
least-derived to most-derived order. See <b>Objects</b> in <cite>S12</cite>

 multi sub chr( Int *@grid  --&gt; Char )
 multi method ord( Str $string: --&gt; Int ) is export
</pre>
		<p><code>chr</code> takes zero or more integer grapheme ids and returns the
corresponding characters as a string.  If any grapheme id is used
that represents a higher abstraction level than the current
lexical scope supports, that grapheme is converted to the
corresponding lower-level string of codepoints/bytes that would
be appropriate to the current context, just as any other Str
would be downgraded in context.</p>
		<p><code>ord</code> goes the other direction; it takes a string value and returns
character values as integers.  In a scalar context, the return value
is the just the integer value of the first character in the string. In
a list context, the return value is the list of integers representing
the entire string.  The definition of character is context dependent.
Normally it's a grapheme id, but under codepoints or bytes scopes,
the string is coerced to the appropriate low-level view and interpreted
as codepoints or bytes.  Hence, under &quot;use bytes&quot; you will never see a
value larger than 256, and under &quot;use codepoints&quot; you will never see a
value larger than 0x10ffff.  The only guarantee under &quot;use graphemes&quot;
(the default) is that the number returned will correspond to the
codepoint of the precomposed codepoint representing the grapheme, if
there is such a codepoint.  Otherwise, the implementation is free to
return any unique id that larger than 0x10ffff.  (The <code>chr</code> function
will know how to backtranslate such ids properly to codepoints or
bytes in any context.  Note that we are assuming that every codepoints
context knows its normalization preferences, and every bytes context
also knows its encoding preferences. (These are knowable in the
lexical scope via the $?NF and $?ENC compile-time constants).)</p>

 our OS::Name multi gethost( Str $name, OS::Addfamily :$type )
 our OS::Name multi method gethost( OS::Addr $addr: ) is export
 our OS::Name multi method gethost( URI $uri: ) is export
</pre>
		<p>The <code>gethost</code> function operates on host naming or address information
and returns an <code>OS::Name</code>. An <code>OS::Name</code> is, minimally:</p>
<pre> class OS::Name {
   has Str $.name;
   has OS::Addr $.addr;
   has Array of Str @.aliases;
   has Array of OS::Addr @.addrs;
 }
</pre>
		<p>Such names can apply to anything which has a name that maps
to an address, however, in this case the name is a hostname
and the address is some sort of network identifier (e.g.
an IPV4 address when resolving hosts that have IPV4 addresses).</p>
		<p>When stringified, an <code>OS::Name</code> yields its name. When
stringified, an <code>OS::Addr</code> yields its address in an
appropriate text format (e.g. &quot;10.1.2.3&quot; for an IPV4 address).</p>
		<p>The optional <code>type</code> adverb can be passed when resolving a hostname,
and will filter the result to only those addresses that are of
the appropriate address family. This feature may be supported by
the underlying operating system, or Perl may emulate it.</p>
		<p>Examples:</p>
<pre>  say &quot;Connection from {$socket.peer.gethost}&quot;;
  my $address = gethost(&quot;foo.example.com&quot;).addr;
  my $hostname = gethost(:addr&lt;&quot;10.1.2.3&quot;&gt;);

	<dd>
<pre> our Bool multi chroot ( Str $path = CALLER::&lt;$_&gt; )
</pre>
		<p>On POSIX systems, changes the context of the current process such
that the &quot;root&quot; directory becomes <code>$path</code> and all rooted paths
(those that begin with a leading path separator) are relative to
that path. For security reasons, many operating systems limit
this functionality to the superuser. The return value will be
true on success.</p>

	<dd>
<pre> our Bool multi kill ( OS::Signal $signal, Bool :$group, *@pids )
 our Bool multi method kill ( Proc::PID $pid: OS::Signal $signal?, Bool :$group )
</pre>
		<p>Sends the given <code>$signal</code> to the process(es) given and returns a boolean
value indicating success (true) if all of the processes existed and were
sent the signal and failure (false) if any of the processes did not exist
or the signal could not be delivered to them.</p>
		<p>The <code>$signal</code> can be initialized from an integer signal number or a
string. Common signals are:</p>
<pre> KILL - stop the process, do not allow it to exit gracefully
 TERM - stop the process, allow it to exit gracefully
 HUP  - Hangup, often used as a request to re-run from scratch
 STOP - Pause execution
 CONT - Continue after a STOP
</pre>
		<p>Consult your operating system documentation for the full list
of signal names and numbers. For compatibility, a signal name
may be prefixed with &quot;SIG&quot;.</p>
		<p>The method form may omit the signal. In this case, the default signal is
<code>'TERM'</code>.</p>
		<p>If the <code>:group</code> named parameter is passed, <code>kill</code> will attempt to
send the signal to a process <i>group</i> rather than a single process.
This functionality is platform-specific.</p>
		<p>The special signal <code>0</code> can be sent which does not actually deliver a
signal at all, and is used to determine if processes are still running:</p>
<pre>  say &quot;Still running&quot; if $proc.kill(0);

 our Proc multi run ( ; Str $path, Bool :$bg!, *@args, :%env = %*ENV )
 our Proc multi run ( Str @path_and_args, Bool :$bg!, :%env = %*ENV )
</pre>
		<p><code>run</code> executes an external program, and returns control to the caller
once the program has exited.</p>
		<p>The default form expects a single string argument which contains the
full command-line. This command-line will be scanned for special
characters that the operating system's shell might interpret such as
<code>;</code> or embedded quotes. If any are found, the command will be run
through a sub-shell in an operating system specific fashion (on
POSIX systems, this means <code>sh -c</code>).</p>
		<p>If called like this:</p>
<pre> run( :path&lt;'/some/path'&gt;, 'arg1', 'arg2', ... )
</pre>
		<p>or with a single array (containing both the path and arguments), then the
path given is executed directly with no shell interpretation.</p>
		<p>The return value is the exit status
of the program, and can be evaluated in the following contexts:</p>
<pre> Bool - True = success; False = failure
 Int  - Exit status (per the .exit method)
</pre>
		<p>See <code>wait</code> for more detail on how the <code>Proc::Status</code> object
is used.</p>
		<p>On failure to execute, an undefined value is returned.</p>
		<p>If the <code>:bg</code> named parameter is passed, the program will be executed
in the background, and the run command will return as soon as the
child process is created. This means that the object returned is
actually a <code>Proc</code>, which represents the created process.</p>
		<p>[ Note: should the :bg form take rw filehandles or is that over-overloading
    the functionality of run? Should run be the new open with
    respect to executing external code? -ajs ]</p>
		<p>[ Note: system() should be renamed to sys() or sh() or run() or
some such to avoid P5-induced boolean inversion confusion, plus
Huffmanize it a little better.  I'm thinking run() might be best
for MMD reasons. --law</p>
		<p>Note: exec should also be renamed to something clearer and &quot;final&quot;
and huffmanly longer.  I'm thinking runinstead().  And maybe the
function behind qq:x should be rungather() rather than readpipe().  -law

		<p>Important Proc::Status methods:</p>
<pre> .exit - Numeric exit value
 .pid - Process ID
 .signal - Signal number if any, otherwise 0
</pre>
		<p>For historical reasons there is a <code>.status</code> method which is equal to:</p>
<pre> ($status.exit +&lt; 8) +| $status.signal
</pre>
		<p>If <code>$process</code> is supplied, then wait will only return when the given process
has exited. Either a full <code>Proc</code> object can be passed, or just a
numeric process ID. A <code>-1</code> explicitly indicates that wait should return
immediately if any child process exits.</p>
		<p>When called in this way, the returned <code>Proc::Status</code> object
will have a <code>.pid</code> of <code>-1</code> (which is also what it numifies to) if
there was no such process to wait for.</p>
