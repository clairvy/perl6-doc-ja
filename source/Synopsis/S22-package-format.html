<h2 id="Terminology_and_Scope">Terminology and Scope</h2>
<div id="Terminology_and_Scope_CONTENT">
<p>I'll start by listing a few terms, and whether this document is supposed to cover them or
not.</p>
<dl>
	<dt>* .jib files; this is the source package format, and is specified in this document</dt>
	<dt>* CPAN6; this is a piece of software for managing an archive network (such as CPAN).
This is not specified in this document; see http://cpan6.org/</dt>
	<dt>* PAUSE6; this is an actual network based on the cpan6 software (see above).  It also
is not documented here.</dt>
	<dt>* CPAN6.pm; this is a piece of software that starts with what it can get on PAUSE6, and
attempts to give you an installed perl module (this is a replacement for
CPANPLUS/cpan2dist)</dt>

<h1 id="PACKAGE_LAYOUT">PACKAGE LAYOUT</h1>
<div id="PACKAGE_LAYOUT_CONTENT">
</div>
<h2 id="Project_directory">Project directory</h2>
<div id="Project_directory_CONTENT">
<p>Step 1 of the general flow should ideally be done by an automated tool, like
p5's current Module::Starter or somesuch. Suffice to say, it should produce
a layout something along these lines (note, this is just an example):</p>
<pre>p5-Foo-Bar/
    lib/
        Foo/
            Bar.pm
    t/
        00_load.t
    _jib/
        META.info
</pre>
<p>The files in the _jib dir are part of the package metadata. The most important
file is the META.info file that holds all the collected metadata about the
package, which ideally gets filled (mostly) by what is described in step 2 of
the <code>General Flow</code>. Any pre/posthook files should also go in this directory.
This directory should be extensible, so new files can be added to extend
functionality.
See the section on <code> Metadata Spec </code> for details.</p>
</div>
<h2 id="jib_files">.jib files</h2>
<div id="jib_files_CONTENT">
<p>These files are created in step 3 of the <code>General Flow</code></p>
<p><code>JIB</code> is a simple 3 letter combination that's not yet 'taken' as
a known extension. It's purposely not perl specific, as there's nothing
about the <code>JIB</code> specification that's limitin it to perl only.</p>
<p># XXX - Also <code>package</code> is carrying double meaning in P6 as both namespace
and source distribution.  Can we remove the former meaning and refer to them
as <code>module</code> and <code>namespace</code> from now on?</p>
<p><code>.jib</code> files are archives designed to distribute source packages, not
installable packages. As we will need to compile things on the client side
(things that have C bits or equivalent), and because we can not know the
install path before hand, a source package is an obvious choice.
A binary, installable package like <code>.deb</code> is therefor no option.</p>
<p>These <code>.jib</code> contain metadata and installable code quite analogous to
the <code>.deb</code> packages we know, except that the metadata is also used to
<code>compile</code> (for the lack of a better term so far) the code on the user side.</p>
<p>The name of a <code>.jib</code> file is determined as follows:</p>
<pre>&lt;prefix&gt;-&lt;package-name&gt;-&lt;version&gt;-&lt;authority&gt;.&lt;extension&gt;
</pre>
<p>In praxis, this will produce a name along these lines:</p>
<pre>p5-Foo-Bar-1.1-cpan+kane.jib
</pre>
<p>The Internal layout is as follows:</p>
<pre>- control.tgz
    * contains the data in the _jib directory
- data.tgz
    * contains the following directories the other directories.
        This may be limited in the future, by say, a manifest.skip
        like functionality, or by dictating a list of directories/
        files that will be included
</pre>
<p>There is room to ship more files alongside the 2 above mentioned archives.
This allows us to ship an extra md5sum, version, signature, anything.</p>
</div>
<h1 id="METADATA_SPEC">METADATA SPEC</h1>
<div id="METADATA_SPEC_CONTENT">
<pre>- Define no more than needed to get started for now
    - Allow for future extensions
    - Use YAML as metadata format as it's portable and available standard
        in perl6
</pre>
</div>
<h2 id="Supported_fields">Supported fields</h2>
<div id="Supported_fields_CONTENT">
<pre>- Prefix        Package prefix category     (p5)
- Name          Perl module name            (Foo-Bar)
- Version       Perl module version         (1.2.3)
- Authority     From S11                    (cpan+KANE)
- Package       Full package name           (p5-Foo-Bar-1.2.3-cpan+kane)
- Description   Description of function     (This is what it does)

                                                p5-Foo-Bar-cpan+kane)
</pre>
<p>As the &lt;Prefix&gt;-&lt;Name&gt;-&lt;Version&gt;-&lt;Authority&gt; combination make up the
&lt;Package&gt; name, arguably, we can leave the former out.
The upside is to make sure all fields contain unique information.
The downside is that 3rd party parsers will need to understand the
<code>Package</code> syntax.</p>
<p>Again, arguably, the <code>Author</code> and <code>Authority</code> fields overlap, and
<code>Authority</code> can be made to hold both cases.</p>
<pre>[1] This is packages, *not* modules. If we need a module -&gt; package
    mapping, this needs to be done when extracting the data from the
    compiler, and queried against the available packages cache.

[a, \[ b, c ] ]             # a OR (b AND c) [1]

[1] This is possibly not portable to other languages. Options seem
    thin as we don't have some /other/ grouping mechanism than [ ], { }
    and \[ ]; ( ) gets flattened and \( ) == [ ].
    We could abuse { } to create { OR =&gt; [ ] } and { AND =&gt; [ ] }
    groups, but it would not read very intuitively. It would also mean
    that the version requirements would have to be in the package naming,
    ie. 'a &gt; 2' rather than a =&gt; '&gt; 2'
