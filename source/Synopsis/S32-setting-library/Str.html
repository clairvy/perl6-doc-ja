<div id="Str_CONTENT">
<p>General notes about strings:</p>
<p>A Str can exist at several Unicode levels at once. Which level you
interact with typically depends on what your current lexical context has
declared the &quot;working Unicode level to be&quot;. Default is <code>Grapheme</code>.
[Default can't be <code>CharLingua</code> because we don't go into &quot;language&quot;
mode unless there's a specific language declaration saying either
exactly what language we're going into or, in the absence of that, how to
find the exact language somewhere in the enviroment.]</p>
<p>Attempting to use a string at a level higher it can support is handled
without warning. The current highest supported level of the string
is simply mapped Char for Char to the new higher level. However,
attempting to stuff something of a higher level a lower-level string
is an error (for example, attempting to store Kanji in a Byte string).
An explicit conversion function must be used to tell it how you want it
encoded.</p>
<p>Attempting to use a string at a level lower than what it supports is not
allowed.</p>
<p>If a function takes a <code>Str</code> and returns a <code>Str</code>, the returned <code>Str</code>
will support the same levels as the input, unless specified otherwise.</p>
<p>The following are all provided by the <code>Str</code> role:</p>
<dl>
	<dt>p5chop</dt>
	<dd>
<pre> our Char multi method p5chop ( Str  $string is rw: ) is export(:P5)
 my Char multi p5chop ( Str *@strings is rw ) is export(:P5)
</pre>
		<p>Trims the last character from <code>$string</code>, and returns it. Called with a
list, it chops each item in turn, and returns the last character
chopped.</p>
	</dd>
	<dt>chop</dt>
	<dd>
<pre> our Str multi method chop ( Str  $string: ) is export
</pre>
		<p>Returns string with one Char removed from the end.</p>
	</dd>
	<dt>p5chomp</dt>
	<dd>
<pre> our Int multi method p5chomp ( Str  $string is rw: ) is export(:P5)
 my Int multi p5chomp ( Str *@strings is rw ) is export(:P5)
</pre>
		<p>Related to <code>p5chop</code>, only removes trailing chars that match <code>/\n/</code>. In
either case, it returns the number of chars removed.</p>
	</dd>
	<dt>chomp</dt>
	<dd>
<pre> our Str multi method chomp ( Str $string: ) is export
</pre>
		<p>Returns string with one newline removed from the end.  An arbitrary
terminator can be removed if the input filehandle has marked the
string for where the &quot;newline&quot; begins.  (Presumably this is stored
as a property of the string.)  Otherwise a standard newline is removed.</p>
		<p>Note: Most users should just let their I/O handles autochomp instead.
(Autochomping is the default.)</p>
	</dd>
	<dt>lc</dt>
	<dd>
<pre> our Str multi method lc ( Str $string: ) is export
</pre>
		<p>Returns the input string after converting each character to its lowercase
form, if uppercase.</p>




	</dd>
	<dt>lcfirst</dt>
	<dd>
<pre> our Str multi method lcfirst ( Str $string: ) is export
</pre>
		<p>Like <code>lc</code>, but only affects the first character.</p>




	</dd>
	<dt>uc</dt>
	<dd>
<pre> our Str multi method uc ( Str $string: ) is export
</pre>
		<p>Returns the input string after converting each character to its uppercase
form, if lowercase. This is not a Unicode &quot;titlecase&quot; operation, but a
full &quot;uppercase&quot;.</p>




	</dd>
	<dt>ucfirst</dt>
	<dd>
<pre> our Str multi method ucfirst ( Str $string: ) is export
</pre>
		<p>Performs a Unicode &quot;titlecase&quot; operation on the first character of the string.</p>
	</dd>
	<dt>normalize</dt>
	<dd>
<pre> our Str multi method normalize ( Str $string: Bool :$canonical = Bool::True, Bool :$recompose = Bool::False ) is export
</pre>
		<p>Performs a Unicode &quot;normalization&quot; operation on the string. This involves
decomposing the string into its most basic combining elements, and potentially
re-composing it. Full detail on the process of decomposing and
re-composing strings in a normalized form is covered in the Unicode
specification Sections 3.7, Decomposition and 3.11,
Canonical Ordering Behavior of the Unicode Standard, 4.0.
Additional named parameters are reserved for future Unicode expansion.</p>
		<p>For everyday use there are aliases that map to the
<i>Unicode Standard Annex #15: Unicode Normalization Forms</i> document's
names for the various modes of normalization:</p>
<pre> our Str multi method nfd ( Str $string: ) is export {
   $string.normalize(:canonical, :!recompose);
 }
 our Str multi method nfc ( Str $string: ) is export {
   $string.normalize(:canonical, :recompose);
 }
 our Str multi method nfkd ( Str $string: ) is export {
   $string.normalize(:!canonical, :!recompose);
 }
 our Str multi method nfkc ( Str $string: ) is export {
   $string.normalize(:!canonical, :recompose);
 }
</pre>
		<p>Decomposing a string can be used to compare
Unicode strings in a binary form, providing that they use the same
encoding. Without decomposing first, two
Unicode strings may contain the same text, but not the same byte-for-byte
data, even in the same encoding.
The decomposition of a string is performed according to tables
in the Unicode standard, and should be compatible with decompositions
performed by any system.</p>
		<p>The <code>:canonical</code> flag controls the use of &quot;compatibility decompositions&quot;.
For example, in canonical mode, &quot;ﬁ&quot; is left unaffected because it is
not a composition. However, in compatibility mode, it will be replaced
with &quot;fi&quot;. Decomposed sequences will be ordered in a canonical way
in either mode.</p>
		<p>The <code>:recompose</code> flag controls the re-composition of decomposed forms.
That is, a combining sequence will be re-composed into the canonical
composite where possible.</p>
		<p>These de-compositions and re-compositions are performed recursively,
until there is no further work to be done.</p>
		<p>Note that this function is really only applicable when dealing with codepoint
strings.  Grapheme strings are normally processed at a higher abstraction level
that is independent of normalization, and are lazily normalized into the
desired normalization when transferred to lexical scopes or handles that care.</p>
	</dd>
	<dt>samecase</dt>
	<dd>
<pre> our Str multi method samecase ( Str $string: Str $pattern ) is export
</pre>
		<p>Has the effect of making the case of the string match the case pattern in <code>$pattern</code>.
(Used by s:ii/// internally, see <cite>S05</cite>.)</p>
	</dd>
	<dt>sameaccent</dt>
	<dd>
<pre> our Str multi method sameaccent ( Str $string: Str $pattern ) is export
</pre>
		<p>Has the effect of making the case of the string match the accent pattern in <code>$pattern</code>.
(Used by s:aa/// internally, see <cite>S05</cite>.)</p>
	</dd>
	<dt>capitalize</dt>
	<dd>
<pre> our Str multi method capitalize ( Str $string: ) is export
</pre>
		<p>Has the effect of first doing an <code>lc</code> on the entire string, then performing a
<code>s:g/(\w+)/{ucfirst $1}/</code> on it.</p>




	</dd>
	<dt>length</dt>
	<dd>
		<p>This word is banned in Perl 6.  You must specify units.</p>
	</dd>
	<dt>chars</dt>
	<dd>
<pre> our Int multi method chars ( Str $string: ) is export
</pre>
		<p>Returns the number of characters in the string in the current
(lexically scoped) idea of what a normal character is, usually graphemes.</p>
	</dd>
	<dt>graphs</dt>
	<dd>
<pre> our Int multi method codes ( Str $string: ) is export
</pre>
		<p>Returns the number of graphemes in the string in a language-independent way.</p>
	</dd>
	<dt>codes</dt>
	<dd>
<pre> our Int multi method codes ( Str $string: $nf = $?NF) is export
</pre>
		<p>Returns the number of codepoints in the string if it were canonicalized the
specified way.  Do not confuse codepoints with UTF-16 encoding.  Characters
above U+FFFF count as a single codepoint.</p>
	</dd>
	<dt>bytes</dt>
	<dd>
<pre> our Int multi method bytes ( Str $string: $enc = $?ENC, :$nf = $?NF) is export
</pre>
		<p>Returns the number of bytes in the string if it were encoded in the
specified way.  Note the inequality:</p>
<pre>.bytes(&quot;UTF-16&quot;,&quot;C&quot;) &gt;= .codes(&quot;C&quot;) * 2
</pre>
		<p>This is caused by the possibility of surrogate pairs, which are counted as one
codepoint.  However, this problem does not arise for UTF-32:</p>
<pre>.bytes(&quot;UTF-32&quot;,&quot;C&quot;) == .codes(&quot;C&quot;) * 4
</pre>
	</dd>
	<dt>encode</dt>
	<dd>
<pre>our Buf multi method encode($encoding = $?ENC, $nf = $?NF)
</pre>
		<p>Returns a <code>Buf</code> which represents the original string in the given encoding
and normal form. The actual return type is as specific as possible, so
<code>$str.encode('UTF-8')</code> returns an <code>utf8</code> object,
<code>$str.encode('ISO-8859-1')</code> a <code>buf8</code>.</p>
	</dd>
	<dt>index</dt>
	<dd>
<pre> our StrPos multi method index( Str $string: Str $substring, StrPos $pos = StrPos(0) ) is export
 our StrPos multi method index( Str $string: Str $substring, Int $pos ) is export
</pre>
		<p><code>index</code> searches for the first occurrence of <code>$substring</code> in <code>$string</code>,
starting at <code>$pos</code>. If $pos is an <code>Int</code>, it is taken to be in the units
of the calling scope, which defaults to &quot;graphemes&quot;.</p>
		<p>The value returned is always a <code>StrPos</code> object.  If the substring
is found, then the <code>StrPos</code> represents the position of the first
character of the substring. If the substring is not found, a bare
<code>StrPos</code> containing no position is returned.  This prototype <code>StrPos</code>
evaluates to false because it's really a kind of undef.  Do not evaluate
as a number, because instead of returning -1 it will return 0 and issue
a warning.</p>




	</dd>
	<dt>pack</dt>
	<dd>
<pre> our Str multi pack( Str::Encoding $encoding,  Pair *@items )
 our Str multi pack( Str::Encoding $encoding,  Str $template, *@items )
 our buf8 multi pack( Pair *@items )
 our buf8 multi pack( Str $template, *@items )
</pre>
		<p><code>pack</code> takes a list of pairs and formats the values according to
the specification of the keys. Alternately, it takes a string
<code>$template</code> and formats the rest of its arguments according to
the specifications in the template string. The result is a sequence
of bytes.</p>
		<p>An optional <code>$encoding</code> can be used to specify the character
encoding to use in interpreting the result as a <code>Str</code>, otherwise the return
value will simply be a <code>buf</code> containing the bytes generated
by the template(s) and value(s). Note that no guarantee is made
in terms of the final, internal representation of the string, only
that the generated sequence of bytes will be interpreted as a
string in the given encoding, and a string containing those
graphemes will be returned. If the sequence of bytes represents
an invalid string according to <code>$encoding</code>, an exception is generated.</p>
		<p>Templates are strings of the form:</p>
<pre>  grammar Str::PackTemplate {
   regex template  { [ &lt;group&gt; | &lt;specifier&gt; &lt;count&gt;? ]* }
   token group     { \( &lt;template&gt; \) }
   token specifier { &lt;[aAZbBhHcCsSiIlLnNvVqQjJfdFDpPuUwxX\@]&gt; \!? }
   token count     { \* |
         \[ [ \d+ | &lt;specifier&gt; ] \] |
         \d+ }
 }
</pre>
		<p>In the pairwise mode, each key must contain a single <code>&lt;group&gt;</code> or
<code>&lt;specifier&gt;</code>, and the values must be either scalar arguments or
arrays.</p>
		<p>[ Note: Need more documentation and need to figure out what Perl 5 things
    no longer make sense. Does Perl 6 need any extra formatting
    features? -ajs ]</p>
		<p>[I think pack formats should be human readable but compiled to an
internal form for efficiency.  I also think that compact classes
should be able to express their serialization in pack form if
asked for it with .packformat or some such.  -law]</p>
	</dd>
	<dt>quotemeta</dt>
	<dd>
<pre> our Str multi method quotemeta ( Str $string: ) is export
</pre>
		<p>Returns the input string with all non-&quot;word&quot; characters back-slashed.
That is, all characters not matching &quot;/&lt;[A..Za..z_0..9]&gt;/&quot; will be preceded
by a backslash in the returned string, regardless of any locale settings.</p>
		<p>[Note from Pm:  Should that be &quot;/\w/&quot; instead?  Or, if the intent
is to duplicate p5 functionality, perhaps it should be &quot;p5quotemeta&quot;?
Do we even want this method at all?]</p>
	</dd>
	<dt>rindex
<span id="rindex">rindex</span></dt>
	<dd>
<pre> our StrPos multi method rindex( Str $string: Str $substring, StrPos $pos? ) is export
 our StrPos multi method rindex( Str $string: Str $substring, Int $pos ) is export
</pre>
		<p>Returns the position of the last <code>$substring</code> in <code>$string</code>. If <code>$pos</code>
is specified, then the search starts at that location in <code>$string</code>, and
works backwards. See <code>index</code> for more detail.</p>
	</dd>
	<dt>split
<span id="split">split</span></dt>
	<dd>
<pre> our List multi split ( Str $delimiter, Str $input, Int $limit = * )
 our List multi split ( Regex $delimiter, Str $input, Int $limit = * )
 our List multi method split ( Str $input: Str $delimiter, Int $limit = * )
 our List multi method split ( Str $input: Regex $delimiter, Int $limit = *, Bool :$all = False)
</pre>
		<p>Splits a string up into pieces based on delimeters found in the string.</p>
		<p>String delimiters must not be treated as rules but as constants.  The
default is no longer '&nbsp;' since that would be interpreted as a constant.
P5's <code>split('&nbsp;')</code> will translate to <code>comb</code>.  Null trailing fields
are no longer trimmed by default.</p>
		<p>The <code>split</code> function no longer has a default delimiter nor a default invocant.
In general you should use <code>words</code> to split on whitespace now, or <code>comb</code> to break
into individual characters.  See below.</p>
		<p>If the <code>:all</code> adverb is supplied to the <code>Regex</code> form, then the
delimiters are returned as <code>Match</code> objects in alternation with the
split values.  Unlike with Perl 5, if the delimiter contains multiple
captures they are returned as submatches of single <code>Match</code> object.
(And since <code>Match</code> does <code>Capture</code>, whether these <code>Match</code> objects
eventually flatten or not depends on whether the expression is bound
into a list or slice context.)</p>
		<p>You may also split lists and filehandles.  <code>$*ARGS.split(/\n[\h*\n]+/)</code>
splits on paragraphs, for instance.  Lists and filehandles are automatically
fed through <code>cat</code> in order to pretend to be string.  The resulting
<code>Cat</code> is lazy.  Accessing a filehandle as both a filehandle and as
a <code>Cat</code> is undefined.</p>
	</dd>
	<dt>comb</dt>
	<dd>
<pre> our List multi comb ( Regex $matcher, Str $input, Int $limit = * )
 our List multi method comb ( Str $input: Regex $matcher = /./, Int $limit = * )
</pre>
		<p>The <code>comb</code> function looks through a string for the interesting bits,
ignoring the parts that don't match.  In other words, it's a version
of split where you specify what you want, not what you don't want.</p>
		<p>That means the same restrictions apply to the matcher rule as do to
split's delimiter rule.</p>
		<p>By default it pulls out all individual characters.  Saying</p>
<pre>$string.comb(/pat/, $n)
</pre>
		<p>is equivalent to</p>
<pre>map {.Str}, $string.match(rx:global:x(0..$n):c/pat/)
</pre>
		<p>You may also comb lists and filehandles.  <code>+$*IN.comb</code> counts the words on
standard input, for instance.  <code>comb(/./, $thing)</code> returns a list of single
<code>Char</code> strings from anything that can give you a <code>Str</code>.  Lists and
filehandles are automatically fed through <code>cat</code> in order to pretend to
be string.  This <code>Cat</code> is also lazy.</p>
		<p>If the <code>:match</code> adverb is applied, a list of <code>Match</code> objects (one
per match) is returned instead of strings.  This can be used to
access capturing subrules in the matcher.  The unmatched portions
are never returned -- if you want that, use <code>split :all</code>.  If the
function is combing a lazy structure, the return values may also be
lazy.  (Strings are not lazy, however.)</p>
	</dd>
	<dt>words</dt>
	<dd>
<pre> our List multi words ( Str $input, Int $limit = * )
 our List multi method words ( Str $input: Int $limit = * )
</pre>
		<p>Returns a list of non-whitespace bits, i.e. the same as a call to
<code>$input.comb( / \S+ /, $limit )</code> would.</p>
	</dd>
	<dt>flip</dt>
	<dd>
		<p>The <code>flip</code> function reverses a string character by character.</p>
<pre> our Str multi method flip ( $str: ) is export {
    $str.comb.reverse.join;
 }
</pre>
		<p>This function will misplace accents if used at a Unicode
level less than graphemes.</p>
	</dd>
	<dt>sprintf</dt>
	<dd>
<pre> our Str multi method sprintf ( Str $format: *@args ) is export
</pre>
		<p>This function is mostly identical to the C library sprintf function.</p>
		<p>The <code>$format</code> is scanned for <code>%</code> characters. Any <code>%</code> introduces a
format token. Format tokens have the following grammar:</p>
<pre> grammar Str::SprintfFormat {
  regex format_token { '%': &lt;index&gt;? &lt;precision&gt;? &lt;modifier&gt;? &lt;directive&gt; }
  token index { \d+ '$' }
  token precision { &lt;flags&gt;? &lt;vector&gt;? &lt;precision_count&gt; }
  token flags { &lt;[ \x20 + 0 \# \- ]&gt;+ }
  token precision_count { [ &lt;[1..9]&gt;\d* | '*' ]? [ '.' [ \d* | '*' ] ]? }
  token vector { '*'? v }
  token modifier { &lt; ll l h m V q L &gt; }
  token directive { &lt; % c s d u o x e f g X E G b p n i D U O F &gt; }
 }
</pre>
		<p>Directives guide the use (if any) of the arguments. When a directive
(other than <code>%</code>) is used, it indicates how the next argument
passed is to be formatted into the string.</p>
		<p>The directives are:</p>
<pre> %   a literal percent sign
 c   a character with the given codepoint
 s   a string
 d   a signed integer, in decimal
 u   an unsigned integer, in decimal
 o   an unsigned integer, in octal
 x   an unsigned integer, in hexadecimal
 e   a floating-point number, in scientific notation
 f   a floating-point number, in fixed decimal notation
 g   a floating-point number, in %e or %f notation
 X   like x, but using upper-case letters
 E   like e, but using an upper-case &quot;E&quot;
 G   like g, but with an upper-case &quot;E&quot; (if applicable)
 b   an unsigned integer, in binary
 C   special: invokes the arg as code, see below
</pre>
		<p>Compatibility:</p>
<pre> i   a synonym for %d
 D   a synonym for %ld
 U   a synonym for %lu
 O   a synonym for %lo
 F   a synonym for %f
</pre>
		<p>Perl 5 (non-)compatibility:</p>
<pre> n   produces a runtime exception (see below)
 p   produces a runtime exception
</pre>
		<p>The special format directive, <code>%C</code> invokes the target argument as
code, passing it the result string that has been generated thus
far and the argument array.</p>
		<p>Here's an example of its use:</p>
<pre> sprintf &quot;%d%C is %d digits long&quot;,
$num,
sub ($s, @args is rw) { @args[2] = $s.elems },
0;
</pre>
		<p>The special directive, <code>%n</code> does not work in Perl 6 because of the
difference in parameter passing conventions, but the example above
simulates its effect using <code>%C</code>.</p>
		<p>Modifiers change the meaning of format directives. The most important being
support for complex numbers (a basic type in Perl). Here are all of the
modifiers and what they modify:</p>
<pre> h interpret integer as native &quot;short&quot; (typically int16)
 l interpret integer as native &quot;long&quot; (typically int32 or int64)
 ll interpret integer as native &quot;long long&quot; (typically int64)
 L interpret integer as native &quot;long long&quot; (typically uint64)
 q interpret integer as native &quot;quads&quot; (typically int64 or larger)
 m interpret value as a complex number
</pre>
		<p>The <code>m</code> modifier works with <code>d,u,o,x,F,E,G,X,E</code> and <code>G</code> format
directives, and the directive applies to both the real and imaginary
parts of the complex number.</p>
		<p>Examples:</p>
<pre> sprintf &quot;%ld a big number, %lld a bigger number, %mf complexity\n&quot;,
4294967295, 4294967296, 1+2i);

<code>sprintf($format, $p.key, $p.value)</code>.</p>

</pre>
		<p><code>substr</code> returns part of an existing string. You control what part by
passing a starting position and optionally either an end position or length.
If you pass a number as either the position or length, then it will be used
as the start or length with the assumtion that you mean &quot;chars&quot; in the
current Unicode abstraction level, which defaults to graphemes.  A number
in the 3rd argument is interpreted as a length rather than a position (just
as in Perl 5).</p>
		<p>Here is an example of its use:</p>
<pre> $initials = substr($first_name,0,1) ~ substr($last_name,0,1);
</pre>
		<p>Optionally, you can use substr on the left hand side of an assignment
like so:</p>
<pre> $string ~~ /(barney)/;
 substr($string, $0.from, $0.to) = &quot;fred&quot;;
