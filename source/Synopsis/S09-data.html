<h1 id="Overview">Overview</h1>
<div id="Overview_CONTENT">
<p>This synopsis summarizes the non-existent Apocalypse 9, which
discussed in detail the design of Perl 6 data structures.  It was
primarily a discussion of how the existing features of Perl 6 combine
to make it easier for the PDL folks to write numeric Perl.</p>
</div>
<h1 id="Lazy_lists">Lazy lists</h1>
<div id="Lazy_lists_CONTENT">
<p>All list contexts are lazy by default.  They still flatten eventually,
but only when forced to.  You have to use the <code>eager</code> list operator to get a
non-lazy flattening list context (that is, to flatten immediately like Perl 5).</p>
</div>
<h1 id="Sized_types">Sized types</h1>
<div id="Sized_types_CONTENT">
<p>Sized low-level types are named most generally by appending the number
of bits to a generic low-level type name:</p>
<pre>int1
int2
int4
int8
int16
int32       (aka int on 32-bit machines)
int64       (aka int on 64-bit machines)

uint1       (aka bit)
uint2
uint4
uint8       (aka byte)
uint16
uint32
uint64

num16
num32
num64       (aka num on most architectures)
num128

complex16
complex32
complex64   (aka complex on most architectures)
complex128

rat8
rat16
rat32
rat64

buf8        aka buf, a &quot;normal&quot; byte buffer
buf16       a uint16 buffer
buf32       a uint32 buffer
buf64       a uint64 buffer
</pre>
<p>Complex sizes indicate the size of each <code>num</code> component rather than
the total.  This would extend to tensor typenames as well if they're
built-in types.  Of course, the typical tensor structure is just
reflected in the dimensions of the array--but the principle still holds
that the name is based on the number of bits of the simple base type.</p>
<p>The unsized types <code>int</code> and <code>num</code> are based on the architecture's
normal size for <code>int</code> and <code>double</code> in whatever version of C the
run-time system (presumably Parrot) is compiled in.  So <code>int</code>
typically means <code>int32</code> or <code>int64</code>, while <code>num</code> usually means
<code>num64</code>, and <code>complex</code> means two of whatever <code>num</code> turns out to be.</p>
<p>You are, of course, free to use macros or type declarations to
associate additional names, such as &quot;short&quot; or &quot;single&quot;.  These are
not provided by default.  An implementation of Perl is not required
to support 64-bit integer types or 128-bit floating-point types unless
the underlying architecture supports them.  16-bit floating-point is
also considered optional in this sense.</p>
<p>And yes, an <code>int1</code> can store only -1 or 0.  I'm sure someone'll think of
a use for it...</p>
<p>Note that these are primarily intended to represent storage types;
the compiler is generally free to keep all intermediate results in
wider types in the absence of declarations or explicit casts to the
contrary.  Attempts to store an intermediate result in a location
that cannot hold it will generally produce a warning on overflow.
Underflow may also warn depending on the pragmatic context and use
of explicit rounding operators.  The default rounding mode from
<code>Num</code> to <code>Int</code> is to truncate the fractional part without warning.
(Note that warnings are by definition resumable exceptions; however,
an exception handler is free to either transform such a warning into
a fatal exception or ignore it completely.)</p>
<p>An explicit cast to a storage type has the same potential to throw an
exception as the actual attempt to store to such a storage location
would.</p>
<p>With IEEE floating-point types, we have a bias towards the use
of in-band <code>+Inf</code>, <code>-Inf</code>, and <code>NaN</code> values in preference to
throwing an exception, since this is construed as friendlier to vector
processing and pipelining.  Object types such as <code>Num</code> and <code>Int</code>
may store additional information about the nature of the failure,
perhaps as an unthrown exception or warning.</p>
</div>
<h1 id="Compact_structs">Compact structs</h1>
<div id="Compact_structs_CONTENT">
<p>A class whose attributes are all low-level value types can behave as
a struct.  (Access from outside the class is still only through
accessors, though, except when the address of a serialized version of
the object is used or generated for interfacing to C-like languages.)
Whether such a class is actually stored compactly is up to the
implementation, but it ought to behave that way, at least to the
extent that it's trivially easy (from the user's perspective) to read
and write to the equivalent C structure.  That is, when serialized
or deserialized to the C view, it should look like the C struct,
even if that's not how it's actually represented inside the class.
(This is to be construed as a substitute for at least some of the
current uses of <code>pack</code>/<code>unpack</code>.)  Of course, a lazy implementation will
probably find it easiest just to keep the object in its serialized form
all the time.  In particular, an array of compact structs must be stored
in their serialized form (see next section).</p>
<p>For types that exist in the C programming language, the serialized
mapping in memory should follow the same alignment and padding
rules by default.  Integers smaller than a byte are packed into a
power-of-two number of bits, so a byte holds four 2-bit integers.
Datum sizes that are not a power of two bits are not supported
unless declared by the user with sufficient information to determine
how to lay them out in memory, possibly with a pack/unpack format
associated with the class, or with the strange elements of the class,
or with the types under which the strange element is declared.</p>
<p>Note that a compact struct is itself a value type, so except for
performance considerations, it doesn't matter how many representations
of it there are in memory as long as those are consistent.</p>
<p>The packing serialization is performed by coercion to an appropriate
buffer type.  The unpacking is performed by coercion of such a buffer
type back to the type of the compact struct.</p>
</div>
<h1 id="Standard_array_indexing">Standard array indexing</h1>
<div id="Standard_array_indexing_CONTENT">
<p>Standard array indices are specified using square brackets. Standard
indices always start at zero in each dimension of the array (see
<a href="#quot_Multidimensional_arrays_quot">&quot;Multidimensional arrays&quot;</a>), and are always contiguous:</p>
<pre>@dwarves[0] = &quot;Happy&quot;;           # The 1st dwarf
@dwarves[6] = &quot;Doc&quot;;             # The 7th dwarf

@seasons[0] = &quot;Spring&quot;;          # The 1st season
@seasons[2] = &quot;Autumn&quot;|&quot;Fall&quot;;   # The 3rd season



</pre>
</div>
<h1 id="Fixed_size_arrays">Fixed-size arrays</h1>
<div id="Fixed_size_arrays_CONTENT">
<p>A basic array declaration like:</p>
<pre>my @array;
</pre>
<p>declares a one-dimensional array of indeterminate length. Such arrays
are autoextending. For many purposes, though, it's useful to define
array types of a particular size and shape that, instead of
autoextending, fail if you try to access outside their
declared dimensionality. Such arrays tend to be faster to allocate and
access as well. (The language must, however, continue to protect you
against overflow--these days, that's not just a reliability issue, but
also a security issue.)</p>
<p>To declare an array of fixed size, specify its maximum number of elements
in square brackets immediately after its name:</p>
<pre>my @dwarves[7];           # Valid indices are 0..6

my @seasons[4];           # Valid indices are 0..3
</pre>
<p>No intervening whitespace is permitted between the name and the size
specification, but &quot;unspace&quot; is allowed:</p>
<pre>my @values[10];           # Okay
my @keys  [10];           # Error
my @keys\ [10];           # Okay
</pre>
<p>Note that the square brackets are a compile-time declarator, not a run-time
operator, so you can't use the &quot;dotted&quot; form either:</p>
<pre>my @values.[10];          # Error
my @keys\ .[10];          # Error
</pre>
<p>Attempting to access an index outside an array's defined range will fail:</p>
<pre>@dwarves[7] = 'Sneaky';   # Fails with &quot;invalid index&quot; exception
</pre>
<p>It's also possible to explicitly specify a normal autoextending array:</p>
<pre>my @vices[*];             # Length is: &quot;whatever&quot;
                          # Valid indices are 0..*
</pre>
</div>
<h1 id="Typed_arrays">Typed arrays</h1>
<div id="Typed_arrays_CONTENT">
<p>The type of value stored in each element of the array (normally <code>Any</code>)
can be explicitly specified too, as an external <code>of</code> type:</p>
<pre>my num @nums;                     # Each element stores a native number
my @nums of num;                  # Same

my Book @library[1_000_000];      # Each element stores a Book object
my @library[1_000_000] of Book;   # Same
</pre>
<p>Alternatively, the element storage type may be specified as part of the
dimension specifier (much like a subroutine definition):</p>
<pre>my @nums[--&gt;num];

my @library[1_000_000 --&gt; Book];



</pre>
</div>
<h1 id="Compact_arrays">Compact arrays</h1>
<div id="Compact_arrays_CONTENT">
<p>In declarations of the form:</p>
<pre>my bit @bits;
my int @ints;
my num @nums;
my int4 @nybbles;
my buf @buffers;
my complex128 @longdoublecomplex;
my Array @ragged2d;
</pre>
<p>the presence of a low-level type tells Perl that it is free to
implement the array with &quot;compact storage&quot;, that is, with a chunk
of memory containing contiguous (or as contiguous as practical)
elements of the specified type without any fancy object boxing that
typically applies to undifferentiated scalars.  (Perl tries really
hard to make these elements look like objects when you treat them
like objects--this is called autoboxing.)</p>
<p>Such arrays are autoextending just like ordinary Perl arrays
(at the price of occasionally copying the block of data to another
memory location, or using a tree structure).</p>
<p>A compact array is for most purposes interchangeable with the
corresponding buffer type.  For example, apart from the sigil,
these are equivalent declarations:</p>
<pre>my uint8 @buffer;
my buf8 $buffer;
</pre>
<p>(Note: If you actually said both of those, you'd still get two
different names, since the sigil is part of the name.)</p>
<p>So given <code>@buffer</code> you can say</p>
<pre>$piece = substr(@buffer, $beg, $end - $beg);
</pre>
<p>and given <code>$buffer</code> you can also say</p>
<pre>@pieces = $buffer[$n..^$end];
</pre>
<p>Note that subscripting still pulls the elements out as numbers,
but <code>substr()</code> returns a buffer of the same type.</p>
<p>For types that exist in the C programming language, the mapping in
memory should follow the same alignment rules, at least in the absence
of any declaration to the contrary.  For interfacing to C pointer
types, any buffer type may be used for its memory pointer; note,
however, that the buffer knows its length, while in C that length
typically must be passed as a separate argument, so the C interfacing
code needs to support this whenever possible, lest Perl inherit all
the buffer overrun bugs bequeathed on us by C.  Random C pointers
should never be converted to buffers unless the length is also known.
(Any call to strlen() should generally be considered a security hole.)
The size of any buffer type in bytes may be found with the <code>.bytes</code>
method, even if the type of the buffer elements is not <code>byte</code>.
(Strings may be asked for their size in bytes only if they support
a buffer type as their minimum abstraction level, hopefully with a
known encoding.  Otherwise you must encode them explicitly from the
higher-level abstraction into some buffer type.)</p>
</div>
<h1 id="Multidimensional_arrays">Multidimensional arrays</h1>
<div id="Multidimensional_arrays_CONTENT">
<p>Perl 6 arrays are not restricted to being one-dimensional (that's simply
the default). To declare a multidimensional array, you specify it with a
semicolon-separated list of dimension lengths:</p>
<pre>my int @ints[4;2];          # Valid indices are 0..3 ; 0..1

my @calendar[12;31;24];     # Valid indices are 0..11 ; 0..30 ; 0..23
</pre>
<p>Arrays may also be defined with a mixture of fixed and autoextending
dimensions.  For example, there are always 12 months in a year and
24 hours in a day, but the number of days in the month can vary:</p>
<pre>my @calendar[12;*;24];     # day-of-month dimension unlimited/ragged
</pre>
<p>You can pass a slice (of any dimensionality) for the shape as well:</p>
<pre>@@shape = (4;2);
my int @ints[ [;]@shape ];
my int @ints[@@shape];      # Same thing
</pre>
<p>Again, the <code>[;]</code> list operator interpolates a list into a semicolon
list.</p>
<p>The shape may be supplied entirely by the object at run-time:</p>
<pre>my num @nums = Array of num.new(:shape(3;3;3));
my num @nums .=new():shape(3;3;3); # same thing
</pre>
<p>A multidimensional array is indexed by a semicolon list, which is really
a list of feeds in disguise. Each sublist is a slice/feed of one
particular dimension. So:</p>
<pre>@array[0..10; 42; @x]
</pre>
<p>is really short for:</p>
<pre>@array.postcircumfix:&lt;[ ]&gt;( &lt;== 0..10 &lt;== 42 &lt;== @x );
</pre>
<p>The compiler is free to optimize to something faster when it is known
that lazy multidimensional subscripts are not necessary.</p>
<p>Note that:</p>
<pre>@array[@x,@y]
</pre>
<p>is always interpreted as a one-dimensional slice in the outermost
dimension, which is the same as:</p>
<pre>@array[@x,@y;]
</pre>
<p>or more verbosely:</p>
<pre>@array.postcircumfix:&lt;[ ]&gt;( &lt;== @x,@y );
</pre>
<p>To interpolate an array at the semicolon level rather than the comma level,
use the <code>[;]</code> reduce operator:</p>
<pre>@array[[;] @x]
</pre>
<p>which is equivalent to</p>
<pre>@array.postcircumfix:&lt;[ ]&gt;( &lt;== @x[0] &lt;== @x[1] &lt;== @x[2]..*);
</pre>
<p>Alternately, use a slice array, indicated by a double <code>@@</code> sigil:</p>
<pre>@array[@@x]
</pre>
<p>Multislice arrays can keep track of their dimensionality as they
are being defined.  Use of slice array syntax can then pull out those
distinct dimensions:</p>
<pre>my @@x;
@@x &lt;==  %hash.keys.grep: {/^\d+$/};
@@x &lt;== lines;
@@x &lt;== 1..*;
@@x &lt;== gather { loop { take 100.rand } };

@array{@@x}
</pre>
<p>Conjecture: since @@x and @x are really the same object, any array can
keep track of its dimensionality, and it only matters how you use it
in contexts that care about the dimensionality:</p>
<pre>my @x;
@x &lt;==  %hash.keys.grep: {/^\d+$/};
@x &lt;== lines;
@x &lt;== 1..*;
@x &lt;== gather { loop { take 100.rand } };

@array{@@x}  # multidimensional
@array{@x}   # flattened
</pre>
</div>
<h2 id="Autoextending_multidimensional_array">Autoextending multidimensional arrays</h2>
<div id="Autoextending_multidimensional_array-2">
<p>Any dimension of the array may be specified as &quot;<code>*</code>&quot;, in which case
that dimension will autoextend.  Typically this would be used in the
final dimension to make a ragged array functionally equivalent to an
array of arrays:</p>
<pre>my int @ints[42; *];            # Second dimension unlimited/ragged
push(@ints[41], getsomeints());
</pre>
<p>but <i>any</i> dimension of an array may be declared as autoextending:</p>
<pre>my @calendar[12;*;24];          # day-of-month dimension unlimited/ragged
@calendar[1;42;8] = 'meeting'   # See you on January 42nd
</pre>
<p>It is also possible to specify that an array has an arbitrary number
of dimensions, using a &quot;hyperwhatever&quot; (<code>**</code>) at the end of the
dimensional specification:</p>
<pre>my @grid[**];                      # Any number of dimensions
my @spacetime[*;*;*;**];           # Three or more dimensions
my @coordinates[100;100;100;**];   # Three or more dimensions
</pre>
<p>Note that <code>**</code> is a shorthand for <code>[;] * xx *</code>, so the extra
dimensions are all of arbitrary size. To specify an arbitrary number
of fixed-size dimensions, write:</p>
<pre>my @coordinates[ [;] 100 xx * ];
</pre>
<p>This syntax is also convenient if you need to define a large number of
consistently sized dimensions:</p>
<pre>my @string_theory[ [;] 100 xx 11 ];    # 11-dimensional
</pre>
</div>
<h1 id="User_defined_array_indexing">User-defined array indexing</h1>
<div id="User_defined_array_indexing_CONTENT">
<p>Any array may also be given a second set of user-defined indices, which
need not be zero-based, monotonic, or even integers. Whereas standard array
indices always start at zero, user-defined indices may start at any
finite value of any enumerable type. Standard indices are always
contiguous, but user-defined indices need only be distinct and in an
enumerable sequence.</p>
<p>To define a set of user-defined indices, specify an explicit or
enumerable list of the indices of each dimension (or the name of an
enumerable type) in a set of curly braces immediately after the
array name:</p>
<pre>my @dwarves{ 1..7 };
my @seasons{ &lt;Spring Summer Autumn Winter&gt; };

my enum Months
    «:Jan(1) Feb Mar Apr May Jun Jul Aug Sep Oct Nov Dec»;

my @calendar{ Months; 1..31; 9..12,14..17 };    # Business hours only
</pre>
<p>Array look-ups via user-defined indices are likewise specified in curly
braces instead of square brackets:</p>
<pre>@dwarves{7} = &quot;Doc&quot;;             # The 7th dwarf

say @calendar{Jan;13;10};        # Jan 13th, 10am
</pre>
<p>User-defined indices merely provide a second, non-standard &quot;view&quot; of the
array; the underlying container remains the same. Each user-defined
index in each dimension is mapped one-to-one back to the standard (zero-
based) indices of that dimension. So, given the preceding definitions:</p>
<pre>             maps to
@dwarves{1}  ------&gt;  @dwarves[0]
@dwarves{2}  ------&gt;  @dwarves[1]
        :                   :
@dwarves{7}  ------&gt;  @dwarves[6]
</pre>
<p>and:</p>
<pre>                    maps to
@seasons{'Summer'}  ------&gt;  @seasons[0]
@seasons{'Spring'}  ------&gt;  @seasons[1]
@seasons{'Autumn'}  ------&gt;  @seasons[2]
@seasons{'Winter'}  ------&gt;  @seasons[3]

@seasons&lt;Summer&gt;    ------&gt;  @seasons[0]
@seasons&lt;Spring&gt;    ------&gt;  @seasons[1]
@seasons&lt;Autumn&gt;    ------&gt;  @seasons[2]
@seasons&lt;Winter&gt;    ------&gt;  @seasons[3]
</pre>
<p>and:</p>
<pre>                      maps to
@calendar{Jan;1;9}    ------&gt;  @calendar[0;0;0]
@calendar{Jan;1;10}   ------&gt;  @calendar[0;0;1]
        :                              :
@calendar{Jan;1;12}   ------&gt;  @calendar[0;0;3]
@calendar{Jan;1;14}   ------&gt;  @calendar[0;0;4]
        :                              :
@calendar{Feb;1;9}    ------&gt;  @calendar[1;0;0]
        :                              :
@calendar{Dec;31;17}  ------&gt;  @calendar[11;30;7]
</pre>
<p>User-defined indices can be open-ended, but only on the upper end (i.e.
just like standard indices). That is, you can specify:</p>
<pre>my @sins{7..*};      # Indices are: 7, 8, 9, etc.
</pre>
<p>but not:</p>
<pre>my @virtue{*..6};
my @koalas{*..*};
my @celebs{*};
</pre>
<p>These last three are not allowed because there is no first index, and
hence no way to map the infinity of negative user-defined indices back
to the standard zero-based indexing scheme.</p>
<p>Declaring a set of user-defined indices implicitly declares the array's
standard indices as well (which are still zero-based in each dimension).
Such arrays can be accessed using either notation. The standard indices
provide an easy way of referring to &quot;ordinal&quot; positions, independent of
user-specified indices:</p>
<pre>say &quot;The first sin was @sins[0]&quot;;
# First element, no matter what @sin's user-defined indexes are
</pre>
<p>Note that if an array is defined with fixed indices (either standard or
user-defined), any attempt to use an index that wasn't specified in the
definition will fail. For example:</p>
<pre>my @values{2,3,5,7,11};   # Also has standard indices: 0..4

say @values[-1];           # Fails (not a valid standard index)
say @values{1};            # Fails (not a valid user-defined index)

say @values{4};            # Fails (not a valid user-defined index)

say @values[5];            # Fails (not a valid standard index)
say @values{13};           # Fails (not a valid user-defined index)
</pre>
<p>Furthermore, if an array wasn't specified with user-defined indices,
<i>any</i> attempt to index it via <code>.{}</code> will fail:</p>
<pre>my @dwarves[7];    # No user-defined indices;

say @dwarves{1};   # Fails: can't map .{1} to a standard .[] index
</pre>
<p>When <code>:k</code>, <code>:kv</code>, or <code>:p</code> is applied to an array slice, it returns
the kind of indices that were used to produce the slice:</p>
<pre>@arr[0..2]:p          # 0=&gt;'one', 1=&gt;'two', 2=&gt;'three'
@arr{1,3,5}:p         # 1=&gt;'one', 3=&gt;'two', 5=&gt;'three'
</pre>
<p>Adverbs may be applied only to operators, not to terms, so <code>:k</code>,
<code>:kv</code>, and <code>:p</code> may not be applied to a full array.  However, you
may apply an adverb to a Zen slice, which can indicate which set of
keys are desired:</p>
<pre>my @arr{1,3,5,7,9} = &lt;one two three four five&gt;;

say @arr[]:k;           # 0, 1, 2, 3, 4
say @arr{}:k;           # 1, 3, 5, 7, 9
</pre>
<p>The <code>.keys</code> method also returns the keys of all existing elements.
For a multidimensional array each key is a list containing one value for
each dimension.</p>
<p>The <code>.shape</code> method also works on such an array; it returns a
slice of the valid keys for each dimension.  The component list
representing an infinite dimension is necessarily represented lazily.
(Note that the <code>.shape</code> method returns the possible keys, but the
cartesian product of the key slice dimensions is not guaranteed to
index existing elements in every case.  That is, this is not intended
to reflect current combinations of keys in use (use <code>:k</code> for that).
Note that you have to distingish these two forms:</p>
<pre>@array[].shape      # the integer indices
@array{}.shape      # the user-defined indices
</pre>
</div>
<h1 id="Inclusive_subscripts">Inclusive subscripts</h1>
<div id="Inclusive_subscripts_CONTENT">
<p>Within any array look-up (whether via <code>.[]</code> or <code>.{}</code>), the &quot;whatever
star&quot; can be used to indicate &quot;all the indices&quot;. The meaning of
&quot;all&quot; here depends on the definition of the array. If there are no
pre-specified indices, the star means &quot;all the indices of currently
allocated elements&quot;:</p>
<pre>my @data                      # No pre-specified indices
    = 21, 43, 9, 11;          # Four elements allocated

<p>If the array is defined with predeclared fixed indices (either standard
or user-defined), the star means &quot;all the defined indices&quot;:</p>
<pre>my @results{1..100 :by(2)}   # Pre-specified indices
    = 42, 86, 99, 1;

say @results[*];              # Same as:  say @results[0..49]
say @results{*};              # Same as:  say @results{1..100 :by(2)}
</pre>
<p>You can omit unallocated elements, either by using the <code>:v</code> adverb:</p>
<pre>say @results[*]:v;            # Same as:  say @results[0..3]
say @results{*}:v;            # Same as:  say @results{1,3,5,7}

<pre>say @results[];               # Same as:  say @results[0..3]
say @results{};               # Same as:  say @results{1,3,5,7}
</pre>
<p>A &quot;whatever star&quot; can also be used as the starting-point of a range
within a slice, in which case it means &quot;from the first index&quot;:</p>
<pre>say @calendar[*..5];          # Same as:  say @calendar[0..5]
say @calendar{*..Jun};        # Same as:  say @calendar{Jan..Jun}

say @data[*..3];              # Same as:  say @data[0..3]
</pre>
<p>As the end-point of a range, a lone &quot;whatever&quot; means &quot;to the maximum
specified index&quot; (if fixed indices were defined):</p>
<pre>say @calendar[5..*];          # Same as:  say @calendar[5..11]
say @calendar{Jun..*};        # Same as:  say @calendar{Jun..Dec}
</pre>
<p>or &quot;to the largest allocated index&quot; (if there are no fixed indices):</p>
<pre>say @data[1..*];              # Same as:  say @results[1..5]
</pre>

<p>The &quot;whatever star&quot; behaves differently than described above when
it is treated as a number inside a standard index.  In this case
it evaluates to the length of the array. This provides a clean
and consistent way to count back or forwards from the end of an
array:</p>
<pre>@array[*-$N]      # $N-th element back from end of array
@array[*+$N]      # $N-th element at or after end of array
</pre>
<p>More specifically:</p>
<pre>@array[*-2]       # Second-last element of the array
@array[*-1]       # Last element of the array
@array[+*]        # First element after the end of the array
@array[*+0]       # First element after the end of the array
@array[*+1]       # Second element after the end of the array

@array[*-3..*-1]  # Slice from third-last element to last element
</pre>
<p>(Note that, if a particular array dimension has fixed indices, any
attempt to index elements after the last defined index will fail.)</p>
<p>Using a standard index less than zero prepends the corresponding number
of elements to the start of the array and then maps the negative index
back to zero:</p>
<pre>@results[-1] = 42;      # Same as: @results.unshift(42)

@dwarves[-2..-1]        # Same as: @dwarves.unshift(&lt;Groovy Sneaky&gt;)
    = &lt;Groovy Sneaky&gt;;
</pre>
<p>Note that, as with a normal <code>unshift</code>, the new elements are
actually stored starting at standard index zero, after pre-existing
elements have been bumped to the right. Hence after the assignments
in the preceding example:</p>
<pre>say @results[0];        # 42
say @dwarves[0];        # Groovy
</pre>
<p>Using a negative index on an array of fixed size will fail if the
resulting number of elements exceeds the defined size.</p>
<p>Note that the behaviour of negative indices in Perl 6 is
different to that in Perl 5:</p>

<h1 id="Mixing_subscripts">Mixing subscripts</h1>
<div id="Mixing_subscripts_CONTENT">
<p>Occasionally it's convenient to be able to mix standard and user-defined
indices in a single look-up.</p>
<p>Within a <code>.[]</code> indexing operation you can use <code>*{$idx}</code> to
convert a user-defined index <code>$idx</code> to a standard index. That is:</p>
<pre>my @lengths{ Months } = (31,28,31,30,31,30,31,31,30,31,30,31);

@lengths[ 2 .. *{Oct} ]      # Same as:  @lengths[ 2 .. 9 ]
</pre>
<p>Similarly, within a <code>.{}</code> indexing operation you can use <code>*[$idx]</code>
to convert from standard indices to user-defined:</p>
<pre>@lengths{ *[2] .. Oct }      # Same as:  @lengths{ Mar .. Oct }
</pre>
<p>In other words, when treated as an array within an indexing
operation, <code>*</code> allows you to convert between standard and
user-defined indices, by acting like an array of the indices
of the indexed array. This is especially useful for mixing
standard and user-defined indices within multidimensional
array look-ups:</p>
<pre># First three business hours of every day in December...
@calendar{Dec; *; *[0..2]}

# Last three business hours of first three days in July...
@calendar[*{July}; 0..2; *-3..*-1]
</pre>
<p>Extending this feature, you can use <code>**</code> within an indexing operation
as if it were a multidimensional array of <i>all</i> the indices of a fixed
number of dimensions of the indexed array:</p>
<pre># Last three business hours of first three days in July...
@calendar{ July; **[0..2; *-3..*-1] }

# Same...
@calendar[ **{July; 1..3}; *-3..*-1]
</pre>
<p>It is also possible to stack subscript declarations of various
types, including a final normal signature to specify named args
and return type:</p>
<pre>my @array[10]{'a'..'z'}(:$sparse --&gt; MyType);
</pre>
</div>
<h1 id="PDL_support">PDL support</h1>
<div id="PDL_support_CONTENT">
<p>An array <code>@array</code> can be tied to a PDL at declaration time:</p>
<pre>my num @array[@@mytensorshape] is PDL;
my @array is PDL(:shape(2;2;2;2)) of int8;
</pre>
<p>PDLs are allowed to assume a type of <code>num</code> by default rather than
the usual simple scalar.  (And in general, the type info is merely
made available to the &quot;tie&quot; implementation to do with what it will.
Some data structures may ignore the &quot;of&quot; type and just store everything
as general scalars.  Too bad...)</p>
<p>Arrays by default are one dimensional, but may be declared to have any
dimensionality supported by the implementation.  You may use arrays
just like scalars -- the main caveat is that you have to use
binding rather than assignment to set one without copying:</p>
<pre>@b := @a[0..*:by(2)]
</pre>
<p>With PDLs in particular, this might alias each of the individual
elements rather than the array as a whole.  So modifications to @b
are likely to be reflected back into @a.  (But maybe the PDLers will
prefer a different notation for that.)</p>
<p>The dimensionality of an array may be declared on the variable, but
the actual dimensionality of the array depends on how it was created.
Reconciling these views is a job for the particular array implementation.
It's not necessarily the case that the declared dimensionality must match
the actual dimensionality.  It's quite possible that the array variable
is deliberately declared with a different dimensionality to provide a
different &quot;view&quot; on the actual value:</p>
<pre>my int @array[2;2] is Puddle .= new(:shape(4) &lt;== 0,1,2,3);
</pre>
<p>Again, reconciling those ideas is up to the implementation, <code>Puddle</code>
in this case.  The traits system is flexible enough to pass any
metadata required, including ideas about sparseness, raggedness,
and various forms of non-rectangleness such as triangleness.
The implementation should probably carp about any metadata it doesn't
recognize though.  The implementation is certainly free to reject
any object that doesn't conform to the variable's shape requirements.</p>

<h1 id="Subscript_and_slice_notation">Subscript and slice notation</h1>
<div id="Subscript_and_slice_notation_CONTENT">
<p>A subscript indicates a &quot;slice&quot; of an array.  Each dimension of an
array is sliced separately, so a multidimensional slice subscript
may be supplied as a semicolon-separated list of slice sublists.
A three-dimensional slice might look like this:</p>
<pre>@x[0..10; 1,0; 1..*:by(2)]
</pre>
<p>It is up to the implementation of <code>@x</code> to decide how aggressively
or lazily this subscript is evaluated, and whether the slice entails
copying.  (The PDL folks will generally want it to merely produce a
virtual PDL where the new array aliases its values back into the
old one.)</p>
<p>Of course, a single element can be selected merely by providing a single
index value to each slice list:</p>

<h1 id="Cascaded_subscripting_of_multidimens">Cascaded subscripting of multidimensional arrays</h1>

<pre>@x[0][1][42]

<p>will either fail or produce the same results as the equivalent
semicolon subscripts:</p>
<pre>@x[0;1;42]
@x[0..10; 1,0; 1..*:by(2)]
</pre>
<p>Built-in array types are expected to succeed either way, even if
the cascaded subscript form must be implemented inefficiently by
constructing temporary slice objects for later subscripts to use.
(User-defined types may choose not to support the cascaded form, but
if so, they should fail rather than providing different semantics.)
As a consequence, for built-in types of declared shape, the appropriate
number of cascaded subscripts may always be optimized into the
semicolon form.</p>
</div>
<h1 id="The_semicolon_operator">The semicolon operator</h1>
<div id="The_semicolon_operator_CONTENT">
<p>At the statement level, a semicolon terminates the current expression.
Within any kind of bracketing construct, semicolon notionally separates
the sublists of a multidimensional slice, the interpretation of
which depends on the context.  Such a semicolon list puts each of its
sublists into a <code>Capture</code>, deferring the context of the sublist until
it is bound somewhere.  The storage of these sublists is hidden in
the inner workings of the list.  It does not produce a list of lists
unless the list as a whole is bound into a slice context.</p>
<p>Single dimensional arrays expect simple slice subscripts, meaning
they will treat a list subscript as a slice in the single dimension of
the array.  Multi-dimensional arrays, on the other hand, know how to
handle a multidimensional slice, with one subslice for each dimension.  You need not specify
all the dimensions; if you don't, the unspecified dimensions are
&quot;wildcarded&quot;.  Supposing you have:</p>
<pre>my num @nums[3;3;3];
</pre>
<p>Then</p>
<pre>@nums[0..2]
</pre>
<p>is the same as</p>
<pre>@nums[0..2;]
</pre>
<p>which is the same as</p>
<pre>@nums[0,1,2;*;*]
</pre>
<p>But you should maybe write the last form anyway just for good
documentation, unless you don't actually know how many more dimensions
there are.  For that case use <code>**</code>:</p>
<pre>@nums[0,1,2;**]
</pre>
<p>If you wanted that <code>0..2</code> range to mean</p>
<pre>@nums[0;1;2]
</pre>
<p>instead, then you need to use the <code>[;]</code> reduction operator:</p>
<pre>@nums[[;] 0..2]
</pre>
<p>The zero-dimensional slice:</p>
<pre>@x[]
</pre>
<p>is assumed to want everything, not nothing.  It's particularly handy
because Perl 6 (unlike Perl 5) won't interpolate a bare array without brackets:</p>
<pre>@x = (1,2,3);
say &quot;@x = @x[]&quot;;    # prints @x = 1 2 3
</pre>
<p>Lists are lazy in Perl 6, and the slice lists are no exception.
In particular, things like range objects are not flattened until they
need to be, if ever.  So a PDL implementation is free to steal the
values from these ranges and &quot;piddle&quot; around with them:</p>
<pre>@nums[$min..$max :by(3)]
@nums[$min..$max]
@nums[$min..*:by(3)]
@nums[1..*:by(2)]           # the odds
@nums[0..*:by(2)]           # the evens
</pre>
<p>That's all just the standard Perl 6 notation for ranges.  Additional
syntactic relief is always available as long as it's predeclared
somehow.  It's possible the range operator could be taught that <code>:2</code>
means <code>:by(2)</code>, for instance.  (But I rather dislike the RFC-proposed
<code>0:10:2</code> notation that makes colon mean two different things so close
together, plus it conflicts with Perl 6's general adverb notation if
the next thing is alphabetic.  On top of which, we're using <code>:2</code> as
a general radix notation.)</p>
<p>Another thing that's not going to fly easily is simply dropping out
terms.  Perl depends rather heavily on knowing when it's expecting
a term or an operator, and simply leaving out terms before or after
a binary operator really screws that up.  For instance,</p>
<pre>0..:by(2)
</pre>
<p>parses as</p>
<pre>0 .. (by =&gt; 2)
</pre>
<p>rather than</p>
<pre>0 .. Inf :by(2)
</pre>
<p>That's why we have <code>..*</code> to mean <code>..Inf</code>.</p>

        Code =&gt; 'double tmp = 0;
                 loop(n) %{ tmp += $a() * $b(); %}
                 $c() = tmp;' );
</pre>
<p>you might want to write a macro that parses something vaguely
resembling this:</p>
<pre>role PDL_stuff[::TYPE] {
    PDLsub inner (@a[$n], @b[$n] --&gt; @c[]) {
        my TYPE $tmp = 0;
        for ^$n {

        }
        @c[] = tmp;
    }

<pre>role PDL_stuff[::TYPE] {
    multi inner (TYPE @a, TYPE @b --&gt; TYPE) {

<p>Then any class that <code>does PDL_stuff[num]</code> has an <code>inner()</code> function that
can (hopefully) be compiled down to a form useful to the PDL threading
engine.  Presumably the macro also stores away the PDL signature
somewhere safe, since the translated code hides that information
down in procedural code.  Possibly some of the <code>[n]</code> information can
come back into the signature via <code>where</code> constraints on the types.
This would presumably make multimethod dispatch possible on similarly
typed arrays with differing constraints.</p>

<p>Some contexts, such as boolean contexts, have special rules for dealing
with junctions.  In any item context not expecting a junction of
values, a junction produces automatic parallelization of the algorithm.
In particular, if a junction is used as an argument to any routine
(operator, closure, method, etc.), and the scalar parameter you
are attempting to bind the argument to is inconsistent with the
<code>junction</code> type, that routine is &quot;autothreaded&quot;, meaning the routine
will be called automatically as many times as necessary to process
the individual scalar elements of the junction in parallel.</p>
<p>The results of these separate calls are then recombined into a
single junction of the same species as the junctive argument.
If two or more arguments are junctive, then the argument that is
chosen to be &quot;autothreaded&quot; is:</p>
<ul>
		<li><p>the left-most <i>all</i> or <i>none</i> junction (if any), or else	</p></li>
		<li><p>the left-most <i>one</i> or <i>any</i> junction</p></li>
</ul>

<p>with the tests applied in that order.</p>
<p>Each of the resulting set of calls is then recursively autothreaded
until no more junctive arguments remain. That is:</p>

</pre>
<p>Junctions passed as part of a container do not cause autothreading
unless individually pulled out and used as a scalar.  It follows that
junctions passed as members of a &quot;slurpy&quot; array or hash do not cause
autothreading on that parameter.  Only individually declared parameters
may autothread.  (Note that positional array and hash parameters are
in fact scalar parameters, though, so you could pass a junction of
array or hash objects.)</p>
<p>The exact semantics of autothreading with respect to control structures
are subject to change over time; it is therefore erroneous to pass
junctions to any control construct that is not implemented via as a
normal single or multi dispatch.  In particular, threading junctions
through conditionals correctly could involve continuations, which
are almost but not quite mandated in Perl 6.0.0.  Alternately, we
may decide that boolean contexts always collapse the junction by
default, and the exact value that allowed the collapse to &quot;true&quot;
is not available.  A variant of that is to say that if you want
autothreading of a control construct, you must assign or bind to
a non-<code>Object</code> container before the control construct, and that
assignment or binding to any such container results in autothreading
the rest of the dynamic scope. (The performance ramifications of this
are not clear without further experimentation, however.)  So for now,
please limit use of junctions to situations where the eventual binding
to a scalar formal parameter is clear.</p>
<p>(Conjucture: in post-Perl 6.0.0 we might introduce an <code>each()</code>
junction which keeps track of its initial values, returning on collapse
those initial values which transformed into a true value, for example</p>
<pre>each(2, 3, 4) - 3
</pre>
<p>would return an unordered collection consisting of 2 and 4, because
<code>2-3</code> and <code>4-3</code> are True in boolean context, while <code>3-3</code> is False.
However it is not yet clear if we really want that, and if yes, in which
context the collapse will occur).</p>

<h1 id="Parallelized_parameters_and_autothre">Parallelized parameters and autothreading</h1>
<div id="Parallelized_parameters_and_autothre-2">
<p>Within the scope of a <code>use autoindex</code> pragma (or equivalent, such as
<code>use PDL</code> (maybe)), any closure that uses parameters as subscripts
is also a candidate for autothreading.  For each such parameter, the
compiler supplies a default value that is a range of all possible
values that subscript can take on (where &quot;possible&quot; is taken to
mean the declared shape of a shaped array, or the actual shape of an
autoextending array).  That is, if you have a closure of the form:</p>
<pre>-&gt; $x, $y { @foo[$x;$y] }
</pre>
<p>then the compiler adds defaults for you, something like:</p>
<pre>-&gt; $x = @foo.shape[0].range,
   $y = @foo.shape[1].range { @foo[$x;$y] }
</pre>
<p>where each such range is autoiterated for you.</p>
<p>In the abstract (and often in the concrete), this puts an implicit
loop around the block of the closure that visits all the possible
subscript values for that dimension (unless the parameter is actually
supplied to the closure, in which case the supplied value is used as
the slice subscript instead).</p>
<p>This implicit loop is assumed to be parallelizable.</p>
<p>So to write a typical tensor multiplication:</p>
<pre>Cijkl = Aij * Bkl
</pre>
<p>you can simply call a closure with no arguments, allowing the <code>autoindex</code>
pragma to fill in the defaults:</p>
<pre>use autoindex;
-&gt; $i, $j, $k, $l { @c[$i; $j; $k; $l] = @a[$i; $j] * @b[$k; $l] }();
</pre>
<p>or you can use the <code>do BLOCK</code> syntax (see <b>&quot;The do-once loop&quot;</b> in <cite>S04</cite>) to
call that closure, which also implicitly iterates:</p>
<pre>use autoindex;
do -&gt; $i, $j, $k, $l {
    @c[$i; $j; $k; $l] = @a[$i; $j] * @b[$k; $l]
}
</pre>
<p>or even use placeholder variables instead of a parameter list:</p>
<pre>use autoindex;
do { @c[$^i; $^j; $^k; $^l] = @a[$^i; $^j] * @b[$^k; $^l] };
</pre>
<p>That's almost pretty.</p>
<p>It is erroneous for an unbound parameter to match multiple existing array
subscripts differently.  (Arrays being created don't count.)</p>
<p>Note that you could pass any of $i, $j, $k or $l explicitly, or prebind
them with a <code>.assuming</code> method, in which only the unbound parameters
autothread.</p>
<p>If you use an unbound array parameter as a semicolon-list interpolator
(via the <code>[;]</code> reduction operator), it functions as a wildcard list of
subscripts that must match the same everywhere that parameter is used.
For example,</p>
<pre>do -&gt; @wild { @b[[;] reverse @wild] = @a[[;] @wild] };
</pre>
<p>produces an array with the dimensions reversed regardless of the
dimensionality of <code>@a</code>.  Since the multidimensional <code>@@wild</code> notation
is more or less equivalent to <code>[;]@wild</code>, you can also write that as:</p>
<pre>do -&gt; @@wild { @b[reverse @@wild] = @a[@@wild] };
</pre>
<p>The optimizer is, of course, free to optimize away any implicit loops
that it can figure out how to do more efficiently without changing
the semantics.</p>
<p>See RFC 207 for more ideas on how to use autothreading (though the syntax
proposed there is rather different).</p>

<h1 id="Hashes">Hashes</h1>
<div id="Hashes_CONTENT">
<p>Like arrays, you can specify hashes with multiple dimensions and fixed
sets of keys:</p>
<pre>my num %hash{&lt;a b c d e f&gt;};        # Only valid keys are 'a'..'f'
my num %hash{'a'..'f'};             # Same thing

my %rainfall{ Months; 1..31 }       # Keys: Jan..Dec ; 1..31
</pre>
<p>Unlike arrays, you can also specify a hash dimension via a non-
enumerated type, which then allows all values of that type as keys in
that dimension:</p>
<pre>my num %hash{&lt;a b c d e f&gt;; Str};   # 2nd dimension key may be any string
my num %hash{'a'..'f'; Str};        # Same thing

my %rainfall{ Months; Int };        # Keys: Jan..Dec ; any integer
</pre>
<p>To declare a hash that can take any object as a key rather than
just a string or integer, say something like:</p>
<pre>my %hash{Any};
my %hash{*};
</pre>
<p>A hash of indeterminate dimensionality is:</p>
<pre>my %hash{**};
</pre>
<p>You can limit the keys to objects of particular types:</p>
<pre>my Fight %hash{Dog; Cat where {!.scared}};
</pre>
<p>The standard Hash is just</p>
<pre>my Any %hash{Str};
</pre>
<p>Note that any type used as a key must be intrinsically immutable,
or it has to be able to make a copy that functions as an immutable key,
or it has to have copy-on-write semantics.  It is erroneous to change
a key object's value within the hash except by deleting it and reinserting
it.</p>
</div>
<h1 id="Autosorted_hashes">Autosorted hashes</h1>
<div id="Autosorted_hashes_CONTENT">
<p>The default hash iterator is a property called <code>.iterator</code> that can be
user replaced.  When the hash itself needs an iterator for <code>.pairs</code>,
<code>.keys</code>, <code>.values</code>, or <code>.kv</code>, it calls <code>%hash.iterator()</code> to
start one.  In item context, <code>.iterator</code> returns an iterator object.
In list context, it returns a lazy list fed by the iterator.  It must
be possible for a hash to be in more than one iterator at a time,
as long as the iterator state is stored in a lazy list.</p>
<p>The downside to making a hash autosort via the iterator is that you'd
have to store all the keys in sorted order, and resort it when the
hash changes.  Alternately, the entire hash could be tied to an ISAM
implementation (not included (XXX or should it be?)).</p>
<p>For multidimensional hashes, the key returned by any hash iterator is
a list of keys, the size of which is the number of declared dimensions
of the hash.  [XXX but this seems to imply another lookup to find the
value.  Perhaps the associated value can also be bundled in somehow.]</p>
</div>
<h1 id="Autovivification">Autovivification</h1>
<div id="Autovivification_CONTENT">
<p>Autovivification will only happen if the vivifiable path is bound to
a read-write container.  Value extraction (that is, binding to a readonly
or copy container) does not autovivify.</p>
<p>Note that assignment is treated the same way as binding to a copy container,
so it does not autovivify its right side either.</p>
<p>Any mention of an expression within a <code>Capture</code> delays the autovivification
decision to binding time.  (Binding to a &quot;ref&quot; parameter also defers the
decision.)</p>
<p>This is as opposed to Perl 5, where autovivification could happen
unintentionally, even when the code looks like a non-destructive test:</p>
<pre># This is Perl 5 code
my %hash;
exists $hash{foo}{bar}; # creates $hash{foo} as an empty hash reference
</pre>
<p>In Perl 6 these read-only operations are indeed non-destructive:</p>
<pre>my %hash;
%hash&lt;foo&gt;&lt;bar&gt; :exists; # %hash is still empty
</pre>
<p>But these bindings <i>do</i> autovivify:</p>
<pre>my %hash;
my $val := %hash&lt;foo&gt;&lt;bar&gt;;

my @array;
my $cap = \@array[0][0]; # $cap is a Capture object - see S02
my :($obj) := $cap;   # @array[0][0] created here

my @array;
foo(@array[0][0]);
sub foo ($obj is rw) {...}  # same thing, basically

my %hash;
%hash&lt;foo&gt;&lt;bar&gt; = &quot;foo&quot;; # duh
</pre>
<p>This rule applies to <code>Array</code>, <code>Hash</code>, and any other container type that
chooses to return an autovivifiable type object (see S12) rather than simply
returning <code>Failure</code> when a lookup fails.  Note in particular that, since
autovivification is defined in terms of type objects rather than failure,
it still works under &quot;use fatal&quot;.</p>
<p>This table solidifies the intuition that an operation pertaining to some data
structure causes the type object to autivivify to such an object:</p>
<pre>operation                autovivifies to
=========                ===============
push, unshift, .[]       Array
.{}                      Hash
</pre>
<p>In addition to the above data structures autovivifying, <code>++</code> and <code>--</code> will
cause an <code>Int</code> to appear, <code>~=</code> will create a <code>Str</code> etc; but these are
natural consequences of the operators working on <code>Failure</code>, qualitatively
different from autovivifying containers.</p>
<p>The type of the type object returned by a non-successful lookup should
be identical to the type that would be returned for a successful lookup.
The only difference is whether it's officially instantiated (defined) yet.
That is, you cannot distinguish them via <code>.WHAT</code> or <code>.HOW</code>, only via
<code>.defined</code>.</p>
<p>Binding of an autovivifiable type object to a non-writeable container
translates the type object into a similar type object without
its autovivifying closure and puts that new type object into the
container instead (with any pertinent historical diagnostic information
carried over).  There is therefore no magical method you can call on
the readonly parameter that can magically autovivify the type object
after the binding.  The newly bound variable merely appears to be a
simple uninitialized value.  (The original type object retains its
closure in case it is rebound elsewhere to a read-write container.)</p>
<p>Some implementation notes:  Nested autovivifications work by making
nested type objects that depend on each other.  In the general case
the containers must produce type objects any time they do not know
how the container will be bound.  This includes when interpolated into
any capture that has delayed binding:</p>
<pre>\( 1, 2, %hash&lt;foo&gt;&lt;bar&gt; )          # must defer
\%hash&lt;foo&gt;&lt;bar&gt;                    # must defer
</pre>
<p>In specific situations however, the compiler can know that a value
can only be bound readonly.  For instance, <code>infix:&lt;+&gt;</code> is
prototyped such that this can never autovivify:</p>
<pre>%hash&lt;foo&gt;&lt;bar&gt; + 42
</pre>
<p>In such a case, the container object need not go through the agony
of calculating an autovivifying closure that will never be called.
On the other hand:</p>
<pre>%hash&lt;foo&gt;&lt;bar&gt; += 42
</pre>
<p>binds the left side to a mutable container, so it autovivifies.</p>
<p>Assignment doesn't look like binding, but consider that it's really
calling some kind of underlying set method on the container, which
must be mutable in order to change its contents.</p>
